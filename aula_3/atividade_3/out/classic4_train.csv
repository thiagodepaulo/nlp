4378,"On Aggression  In this book, Lorenz deals with the evolution of aggression in vertebrates. He points out that aggressivity is totally different from predation: that it is a biological necessity for defence of territory and for a cornered animal, and that it becomes mixed up with other innate drives, thus leading up towards reduction of intraspecific damage. This, be it noted, is most evident in fiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the pack is virtually impossible and where co-operation without fighting is necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbially peaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often fatal attacks on the weaker mate.  In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in the human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, and not guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, the aggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels. Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior, many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found in animals. In any event, On Aggression is a fascinating book by a master of his subject. ",cisi

System performance is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed.  It is shown that significant improvements in the measure of system performance can be obtained by using variable time-slice techniques and by selecting the optimum round-robin cycle time. It appears that these features would benefit from optimization whereas other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm affect system performance in a predictable manner and would not benefit from optimization. Features not normally under the control of the scheduling algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure of performance; in particular, supervisor overheads, the size of the store, and the speed of the CPU. A comparison is made between the results of the simulation model and two analytical equations for quantum-oriented nonpreemptive time-sharing systems. The comparison is found to be very favorable.

The lack of theory can be attributed partly to the practical orientation of many of the studies and also to the fact that an adequate model cannot be based on any one of these types of studies alone.. A useful theory must integrate knowledge from all three types.. In this article, we will review these studies and will describe a teoretical model which has been designed to fill this purpose..

1565,"A Lattice Model of Secure Information Flow This paper investigates mechanisms that guarantee secure information flow in a computer system. These mechanisms are examined within a mathematical framework suitable for formulating the requirements of secure information flow among security classes. The central component of the model is a lattice structure derived from the security classes and justified by the semantics of information flow. The lattice properties permit concise formulations of the security requirements of different existing systems and facilitate the construction of mechanisms that enforce security.  The model provides a unifying view of all systems that restrict information flow, enables a classification of them according to security objectives, and suggests some new approaches. It also leads to the construction of automatic program certification mechanisms for verifying the secure flow of information through a program. ",cacm

In the first experiment, an attempt was made to construct a sentence dictionary of syntactic sentence types, for distinguishing extract-worthy sentences, but it proved unrewarding.. Nevertheless, the results indicated that sentence typing might be used in a screening process in conjunction with other extracting techniques.. The later attempts to combine synactic and statistical criteria in the choice of extract sentences and index phrases proved more rewarding.. The sentences selected by the extracting algorithm were representative and are presented for the reader to peruse.. The noun phrases selected by the indexing algorithm compared favorably with the back-of-the-book index phrases..

Work in programming methodology has led to the realization that three kinds of abstractions-procedural, control, and especially data abstractions-are useful in the programming process. Of these, only the procedural abstraction is supported well by conventional languages, through the procedure or subroutine.  CLU provides, in addition to procedures, novel linguistic mechanisms that support the use of data and control abstractions. This paper provides an in troduction to the abstraction mechanisms in CLU. By means of programming examples, the utility of the three kinds of abstractions in program construction is illustrated, and it is shown how CLU programs may be written to use and implement abstractions.

He advocates a divided catalog such as the one at Amherst because, for one thing, the separate catalog can more readily be used in conjunction with bibliographies in the subject fields. We find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography (Harris, 1957). Fletcher's article seems to have been followed by more than thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subject of the divided catalog. During that period there were probably some divisions of catalogs at some libraries but, as Thom (q.v.) indicates, the greatest period of such activity started in 1937. Our survey of the literature on the divided catalog corroborates this since 1938 in the year in which the steady stream of papers on the subject began. ",cisi

These programs are actually proceeding intermittently and singly, according to eligibility (readiness to proceed) and priority.  It is useful to be able to represent them as proceeding continuously and simultaneously, each at an effective rate, which may be a fraction of that which it would enjoy in the absence of the other programs. The effective progress rate of each program is sensitive to many detailed characteristics of itself and its co-residents and simulation has been the best available method of predicting it.

4584,"Computational Analysis of Scoring Models for R and D Project Selection  Several authors have proposed using scoring models for prescriptive analysis of the R and D project selection decision problem. This research indicates that these models do not meet with important practical requirements. For example, many authors recommend a multiplicative index, over an additive index, in order to generate a wide range of project scores. The additive index is shown to have important advantages over the multiplicative index. The most serious shortcoming in the models, however, is the relatively arbitrary fashion in which the models have been constructed and the failure of the model builders to recognize the impact of certain structural considerations on resulting project scores. Comparative analyses relating project rankings produced by scoring models to rankings produced by a profitability index and by a linear programming model demonstrate that the performance of the scoring model is highly sensitive to decisions made during the development of the model. Considerations such as (1) the underlying distributions of project data, (2) time preferences, (3) the number of ranking intervals or categories, and (4) the width of the intervals, all have important implications for final project scores and associated rankings.

4243,"The Divided Catalog  As early as 1905 the divided catalog was being presented as a preferable alternative to the dictionary catalog. Writing in 1958 Dorothy Grosser found that the steady stream of papers on the subject began in 1938. She reported 21 articles based on actual experience with the divided catalog. A quick check of her list discloses that all divided catalogs are not represented by articles. She recorded nine opponents of the divided catalog and six better known members of the profession reserving judgement. Lyle in his new edition of The Administration of the College Library considers it ""safer,"" rather than ""wiser"" as in his earlier edition, to await further evidence. Faced at Central Methodist College Library with a dictionary catalog which had outgrown its cabinets and which was to be expanded, a survey of catalog user opinion was undertaken to determine if some division of the catalog should be considered. Some revision of the filing would be needed anyway because of inconsistencies which had crept in, largely involving the inter-filing of subject and title entries. The following questions were asked of all users of the catalog during hours selected at random over several weeks:  1. Are you looking for a particular book or for books on a particular subject?   Were you looking under author, title, or subject?  2. What is your greatest difficulty in using the catalog?  3. How would you feel about having the subject cards in a separate file?  One hundred persons, approximately one tenth of the campus population, were questioned; 93 per cent felt that they would prefer having subject cards in a separate catalog, 5 per cent were opposed, and 2 per cent undecided. It must be admitted that the prejudice of the person asking may have influenced the way in which the question was answered - a similar survey made in 1954 by the University of Toronto showed general support for the dictionary catalog.

4662,"Least Cost Decision Rules for the Selection of Library Materials for Compact Storage   For the last several decades library collections have been growing at exponential rates with no relief evident in the future..   To help ease the growing financial burden of housing their collections, many librarians have suggested employment compact storage depositories for little-used materials.. Two aspects to be considered in designing a storage system are: the fraction of the collection which is to be stored; and the criteria to be used for selecting materials for storage.. This study demonstrates that for a given selection criterion least-cost storage quantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and the small shelving costs associated with stored materials..   Two storage criteria, one based upon the age of the materials and the other utilizing the individual book usage rates, are discussed and compared.. For the age policy the objective is the determination of a least-cost critical age at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines the fraction of the collection that should be stored.. The model assumes that the circulation rate of the books decline with age according to an average geometric pattern of obsolescence..   The average time gap between the most recent circulations of books is utilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book.. The storage decision variable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usage rate policy is a critical intercirculation gap, the maximum amount of time that a book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without being used.. Those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for which the time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap.. Hence, although the least-cost selection rule is independent of the composite distribution of usage rates, the fraction of the collection stored depends upon the circulation activities of the individual libraries..   An empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collected from three libraries at Purdue University and estimates of cost parameters extracted from the literature.. Calculations for the least-cost decision rules and the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized from storage of materials, but the calculations indicate that a large portion of the collection must be stored..   Comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that the latter criterion is preferred for all cases examined, including a situation where the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unit relocation cost..   Sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of values show that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relatively insignificant effect on the decision rules; that changes in the capacity-related cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results; and that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation cost differential.. An important component of the latter consideration is a rather subjective estimate for the cost of a service delay, which appears to have a potentially large influence on the decision rules.. ",cisi

A detailed implementation combining the most effective improvements to Quicksort is given, along with a discussion of how to implement it in assembly language. Analytic results describing the performance of the programs are summarized. A variety of special situations are considered from a practical standpoint to illustrate Quicksort's wide applicability as an internal sorting method which requires negligible extra storage. ",cacm
1729,"Connections Between Accuracy and Stability Properties of Linear Multistep Formulas This paper is concerned with stability and accuracy of families of linear k-step formulas depending on parameters, with particular emphasis on the numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations.  An upper bound, p=k, is derived for the order of accuracy of A(inf)-stable formulas. Three criteria are given for A(0)-stability. It is shown that (1) for p=k, k arbitrary, A(inf)-stability implies certain necessary conditions for A(0)-stability and for strict stability (meaning that the extraneous roots of p(psi) satisfy |psi|<1); (2) for p=k=2,3,4,and 5, A(inf)-stability (for k=5 together with another constraint) implies strict stability; and (3) for certain one-parameter classes of formulas with p=k=3,4,and/or 5, A(inf)-stability implies A(0)-stability.

2979,"Extending the Information Theory Approach to Converting Limited-Entry Decision Tables to Computer Programs This paper modifies an earlier algorithm for converting decision tables into flowcharts which minimize subsequent execution time when compiled into a computer program. The algorithms considered in this paper perform limited search and, accordingly, do not necessarily result in globally optimal solutions. However, the greater search effort needed to obtain a globally optimal solution for complex decision tables is usually not justified by sufficient savings in execution time. There is an analogy between the problem of converting decision tables into efficient flowcharts and the well-understood problem in information theory of noiseless coding. The results of the noiseless coding literature are used to explore the limitations of algorithms used to solve the decision table problem. The analogy between the two problems is also used to develop improvements to the information algorithm in extending the depth of search under certain conditions and in proposing additional conditions to be added to the decision table. Finally, the information algorithm is compared with an algorithm proposed in a recent paper by Verhelst. ",cacm

Whilst we recognize that some of the methods described here, particularly in Part II of the book, are more widely applicable, we have deliberately limited discussion to biological taxonomy.

As a result a rapid and large increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and biophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. The consequent enormous growth of literature in the field has created great difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. To cope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicals in this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual review of biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect the impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately than the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out the predominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort today, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemical methodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been developed and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters which should be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in relation to the number of paper published, compactness of the information content, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of presentation..   The results of the present study have been discussed in relation to Bradford's Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested, namely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a scientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear in increasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field..

(This segmented division is denoted here as a (2, 1) precision basic division.)  It is found that the normalization requirement could be narrowed down to a smaller range of divisors, provided the magnitude of the character next to the leading character of the divisor is known. If, however, the normalization is to be eliminated one has to choose proper higher precision segments of operands for the basic division. Also considered is the possibility of eliminating the normalization by an increase on the number of corrections on the quotient estimate got from a (2, 1) precision basic division.  It is shown that such a scheme is economical only for small radices. ",cacm

A major purpose was to discover how valuable the publications are to users and what impact they have had on their own research or professional practice as well as on their information seeking behaviour. Comparisons are made between the results for the two publications. Some conclusions are drawn on information seeking behaviour in the neuroscience community and on requirements for effective current awareness services in this field. ",cisi

2399,"Multi-attribute Retrieval with Combined Indexes In this paper a file organization scheme designed to replace the use of the popular secondary index filing scheme (or inverted files on secondary key fields) is described. Through the use of redundancy and storing keys (or access numbers of the records) that satisfy different combinations of secondary index values in ""buckets,"" it is possible to retrieve all keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset of fields by a single access to an index file, although each bucket may be used for many combinations of values and a combination of buckets may be required for a given query. The method which, in its degenerate case, becomes the conventional secondary index filing scheme works similarly but has the following advantages: (1) the elimination of multiple accesses in many cases; (2) the elimination of false drops; (3) the elimination of computer time to perform intersection of key sets each qualified for one secondary index field only; and (4) the avoidance of long strings of keys when an index field appearing in a query has very few possible values. Redundancy, in some cases, is the same as the secondary indexing method. In the general case, trade-off between the number of accesses for query and redundancy exists. ",cacm

1029,"Automatic Generation of Efficient Lexical Processors Using Finite State Techniques The practical application of the theory of finite-state automata to automatically generate lexical processors is dealt with in this tutorial article by the use of the AED RWORD system, developed at M.I.T. as part of the AED-1 system. This system accepts as input description of the multicharacter items or of words allowable in a language given in terms of a subset of regular expressions. The output of the system is a lexical processor which reads a string of characters and combines them into the items as defined by the regular expressions. Each output item is identified by a code number together with a pointer to a block of storage containing the characters and character count in the item. The processors produced by the system are based on finite-state machines.  Each state of a ""machine"" corresponds to a unique condition in the lexical processing of a character string. At each state a character is read, and the machine changes to a new state. At each transition appropriate actions are taken based on the particular character read. The system has been in operation since 1966, and processors generated have compared favorably in speed to carefully hand-coded programs to accomplish the same task. Lexical processors for AED-O and MAD are among the many which have been produced. The techniques employed are independent of the nature of the items being evaluated. If the word ""events"" is substituted for character string, these processors may be described as generalized decision-making mechanisms based upon an ordered sequence of events. This allows the system to be used in a range of applications outside the area of lexical processing. However convenient these advantages may be, speed is the most important consideration.  In designing a system for automatic generation of a lexical processor, the goal was a processor which completely eliminated backup or rereading, which was nearly as fast as hand-coded processors, which would analyze the language and detect errors, and which would be convenient and easy to use.

Thus the algorithm has the unusual property that, in most cases, not all of the first i characters of string are inspected. The number of characters actually inspected (on the average) decreases as a function of the length of pat. For a random English pattern of length 5, the algorithm will typically inspect i/4 characters of string before finding a match at i. Furthermore, the algorithm has been implemented so that (on the average) fewer than i+patlen machine instructions are executed. These conclusions are supported with empirical evidence and a theoretical analysis of the average behavior of the algorithm.  The worst case behavior of the algorithm is linear in i+patlen, assuming the availability of array space for tables linear in patlen plus the size of the alphabet. ",cacm

The problem is academic in the sense that ordinarily the optimal tree cannot be implemented by means of practical techniques. On the other hand, it is potentially useful for the comparison it affords between observed performance and that of an intuitively attractive ideal search procedure. As a practical application of such a model this paper considers the design of a novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representation of data and shows that essentially the same algorithm can be used to design either an ideal search tree or a bit-vector tree.

This strategy is developed by devoting considerable attention to the nature of the concept of satisfaction, and, particularly, to the requirements for scientifically adequate measures of satisfaction. In fact, it is the emphasis on a comprehensive set of requirements for sound measurement, rather than on just one or two elements of it, which is the quality that sets this book apart from any previous report in the area of job satisfaction.   Not the least of the values of this book is its basic utility for both academicians and practitioners. For the former, it should serve as a powerful spur and guide to further fundamental research on the nature and correlates of satisfaction. For too many years we in this area have been plagued by inadequately conceived and poorly developed measuring devices. This has led to a plethora of studies each using a different scale or measuring instrument. As a consequence, this has opened the door for almost anyone to claim the solution for making sense of the jigsaw pattern of findings relating to satisfaction. At the very least, the present volume should provide researchers with a thoroughly developed measuring instrument that will allow comparability of results across studies. If so, this may well bring some meaningful order to the present rather chaotically structured literature on job satisfaction. ",cisi

But in spite of all the evidence, we refused to believe that ignorance of psychology is a cybernetic prerequisite or even an advantage. There must be some way to phrase the new ideas so that they can contribute to and profit from the science of behavior that psychologists have created.

88,"On the Relative Efficiencies of Context-Free Grammar Recognizers A number of diverse recognition procedures that have been proposed for parsing sentences with respect to a context-free grammar are described in this paper by means of a common device. Each procedure is defined by giving an algorithm for obtaining a nondeterministic Turing Machine recognizer that is equivalent to a given context-free grammar. The formalization of the Turing Machine has been chosen to make possible particularly simple description of the parsing procedures considered. An attempt has been made to compare recognition efficiencies for the procedures defined. For a few simple grammars and sentences a formal comparison has been made. Empirical comparison of the recognition of more realistic programming languages such as LISP and ALGOL has been made by means of a program which simulates the Turing Machine on the Univac M-460 computer. Several algorithms for producing grammars equivalent to a given context-free grammar have been considered, and the increase in recognition efficiency they afford has been empirically investigated.

When given 68 facts, DEDUCOM answered 10 questions answerable from the facts.  A fact tells DEDUCOM either some specific information or a method of answering a general kind of question.  Some conclusions drawn in the article are: (1) DEDUCOM can answer a wide variety of questions. (2) A human can increase the deductive power of DEDUCOM by telling it more facts. (3) DEDUCOM can write very simple programs (it is hoped that this ability is the forerunner of an ability to self-program, which is a way to learn). (4)DEDUCOM's search procedure at present has two bad defects: some questions answerable from the given facts cannot be answered and some other answerable questions can be answered only if the relevant facts are given in the ""right"" order.  (6) At present, DEDUCOM's method of making logical deductions in predicate calculus has two bad defects: some facts have to be changed to logically equivalent ones before being given to DEDUCOM, and some redundant facts have to be given to DEDUCOM.

In libraries, museums, and private homes preventive care is regularly given to pictures and sculpture, fine furniture, silver and brass; but the gradually deteriorating volumes on the shelves are given no more attention than an occasional dusting which abrades the books more than it protects them. I would judge that more than 90 percent of the books and documents that come to my bindery for repair or restoration are in a condition that could have been avoided by regular and appropriate preventive care.

2615,"An Optimal Insertion Algorithm for One-Sided Height-Balanced BInary Search Trees An algorithm for inserting an element into a one-sided height-balanced (OSHB) binary search tree is presented. The algorithm operates in time O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This represents an improvement over the best previous ly known insertion algorithms of Hirschberg and Kosaraju, which require time O(log 2n). Moreover, the O(log n) complexity is optimal. Earlier results have shown that deletion in such a structure can also be performed in O(log n) time. Thus the result of this paper gives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees should be the first examples of their kind, where deletion has a smaller time complexity than insertion. Furthermore, it can now be concluded that insertion, deletion, and retrieval in OSHB trees can be performed in the same time as the corresponding operations for the more general AVL trees, to within a constant factor. However, the insertion and deletion algorithms for OSHB trees appear much more complicated than the corresponding algorithms for AVL trees. ",cacm

The computer uses ""enclosure"" and ""connector words"" for determining when a multi-sentence passage should be retrieved.. However, no procedure was found in this study for retrieving multi-paragraph answer-passages, which were the only answer-passages occurring in 6% of the papers..   In a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve two answer-providing documents (7% of those to be retrieved) because of one multi-paragraph answer-passage and one complete failure of clue word selection.. For the other answer-providing documents they retrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than SMART, which has produced the best previously reported recall-precision results..   The retrieval questions (mostly from real users) and documents used in this study were from the field of information science.. The results of the study are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a ""soft science,"" and it is reasonable to hope that in less ""soft"" sciences and technologies the techniques described will work even better.. On this basis a dissemination and retrieval system of the near future is predicted.. ",cisi

But in doing so, they overlook an extremely significant era in the history of our profession, for the quarter century preceding the 1876 meeting in Philadelphia was one characterized by great advances in the field of American librarianship. This period of growth was to have considerable influence on the course of library development in America after 1876.

The experiment is a retrieval experiment and uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by nonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using the Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the usual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the statistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the ""optimal"" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few documents are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more effective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents are wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same average breadth where one indexing consists of semantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the other consists of merely ""reasonable"" index terms..

3668,"Subject Analysis: Computer Implications of Rigorous Definator   Subject analysis for information retrieval is an area which always seems deceptively simple to those without previous background in it, however extensive their background in specific subject disciplines may be. The basic requirement seems easy enough: to structure the statement of a subject in such a way that it can be placed into, and retrieved from, an ordered file.   While attempts have been made to use simple, non-complex terms or even single words, it always becomes evident that single words are often insufficient to express a subject, and that some subjects are in themselves complex. To express such subjects requires either that their constituent concepts -- not words -- be separated and then recombined, or that only one part of the subject be shown.   The former solution requires that the indexer perform the necessary analysis and synthesis, and then separate the constituents for the searcher to reassemble. The latter forces the seeker of information to sort through many items to find those bearing on the complex topic he wants, and ma require the indexer to decide under which part(s) of the concept an entry should be made.

Production of monographs and journals, research reports and government documents has been increasing exponentially to the point that British university librarians are beginning to feel the sense of constriction of space which their American counterparts have been struggling with for a number of years (judging by the amount of print devoted to the subject in American library journals). The force of this sense of constriction has been somewhat mitigated in all but the copyright libraries by the general lack of funds available for book purchasing, and by the increasing price of books. However, when space in the library does become filled, obviously something must be done to create more space, because the flow of material is certainly not going to cease. ",cisi

1106,Numerical Properties of the Ritz-Trefftz Algorithm for Optimal Control In this paper the Ritz-Trefftz algorithm is applied to the computer solution of the state regulator problem. The algorithm represents a modification of the Ritz direct method and is designed to improve the speed of solution and the storage requirements to the point where real-time implementation becomes feasible. The modification is shown to be more stable computationally than the traditional Ritz approach.  The first concern of the paper is to describe the algorithm and establish its properties as a valid and useful numerical technique. In particular such useful properties as definiteness and reasonableness of condition are established for the method. The second part of the paper is devoted to a comparison of the new techniques with the standard procedure of numerically integrating a matrix Riccati equation to determine a feedback matrix. The new technique is shown to be significantly faster for comparable accuracy. ,cacm

While this assumption is somewhat unrealistic, it is intended to provide an opportunity to concentrate on the other aspects of program construction.

As a result of these developments, a coherent theory of library classification has been established in each of its three major departments - in subject analysis, in notation, and in the alphabetical indexing of systematic orders.

2491,"A Grammar Base Question Answering Procedure The subject of this paper is a procedure for the automatic retrieval of certain segments of stored information, either explicitly or implicitly represented, through questions posed in natural language sentences. This procedure makes use of a sentence recognition device for the class of grammars which will correctly decide between the grammatical and ungrammatical sentences of a natural language. It is possible to make use of a recognition device of this sort for the following reason: Much data is fully expressible as a set of sentences in a natural language, a set which can be exhaustively and exclusively generated by a grammar. Based upon the rules of this grammar, a sentence recognizer will evaluate sentences, questions in the normal situation. Since the recognition function succeeds just in case the posed question is drawn from the set of sentences expressing the data, or, more correctly, is grammatical in terms of the grammar for this set of sentences, sentence recognition itself is a procedure for retrieving information.  When the recognition function succeeds, its value represents the requested information. ",cacm

4598,"A Mathematical Theory of Communication  In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the signals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast with the discrete nature assumed until now. To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases.  We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results with the greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, since this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would obscure the main thread of the analysis. A preliminary study, however, indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic and rigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases and many others. The occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in the present analysis can be justified in all cases of practical interest. ",cisi

Priority changes dynamically as a function of the difference between the service promised to the user by the policy function and the service he actually receives. A scheduling and swapping algorithm which keeps the resource count of each process above its policy function will provide the specified level of service. Overhead can be reduced by avoiding swaps of process which have received at least his level of service. The algorithm has been implemented in a general purpose operating system, and it has provided significantly better service to interactive and to batch jobs than the previous scheduler. ",cacm

With n a power of two, computing time for this algorithm is proportional to n log2 n, a major improvement over other methods with computing time proportional to n^2.  In this paper, the fast Fourier transform algorithm is briefly reviewed and fast difference equation methods for accurately computing the needed trigonometric function values are given. The problem of computing a large Fourier transform on a system with virtual memory is considered, and a solution is proposed. This method has been used to compute complex Fourier transforms of size n = 2^16 on a computer with 2^15 words of core storage; this exceeds by a factor of eight the maximum radix two transform size with fixed allocation of this amount of core storage. The method has also been used to compute large mixed radix transforms. A scaling plan for computing the fast Fourier transform with fixed-point arithmetic is also given. ",cacm

The idea of this was certainly not new; Fairthorne had more than implied it in his discussions on OBNA and ABNO systems, i.e. Only-But-Not-All (high precision) and All-But-Not- Only (high recall). However, it was one of the propositions arising from Cranfield I which met with strong opposition and was quite rightly attacked. In reply to the critical review by Swanson, I had to agree that the simple hypothesis required modification. By the following year test results coming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II made further modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forward to read as follows: 'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence of subsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expected decreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question, there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the results of a number of different searches are averaged.

To derive these equations by this method, the user need know only the coordinate transformation equations relating the curvilinear coordinates of interest to an orthogonal Cartesian triad. When this program is used and the coordinate transformation equations are supplied as input, the computer will derive the Navier-Stokes equations and the continuity equation. The equations obtained will be relative to the curvilinear coordinate system specified by the transformation equations used as input. In this paper the emphasis is on theoretical considerations and methodology rather than on programming details.  Results are presented for cylindrical polar and spherical polar coordinate systems.

6194,"major surgery on the severe hemophiliac, lessons in management. three cases of pseudotumor of the thigh which required surgical amputation and one case of open pericardial drainage for cardiac tamponade are briefly reported in severe hemophiliacs. in the first case hemostasis, following amputation, was produced, but the patient died of septicemia secondary to proximally infected tissues; the level of amputation should, therefore, be proximal to all grossly infected tissues. in the second case, with infected massive pseudotumor of the left thigh, 5 separate operative procedures were performed. the last procedure was elective revision of skin flaps at the hip disarticulation site. here application of the knowledge gained from previous experience resulted in a completely uncomplicated postoperative course by dint of timing of the surgical procedure in relation to control of infection, loss of plasma fastness, and the judicious use of antibiotic and direct-current electrocoagulation therapy. a plea is made to avoid the use of plasma and ahg therapy in hemophilias for trivial reasons and to consider patients for surgical procedures early in the course of their complications, which demand surgery, at a time when the patient is still responsive to hematologic therapy and prior to the onset of infection in areas of hematoma. it is felt that a second significant hemorrhage in any particular site constitutes a bona fide indication for surgical intervention, long before the time when surgery is considered as the last resort by the physician, patient and family. although the authors believe that surgery in the hemophiliac is not to be taken lightly, they do not endorse the prevailing nihilistic attitude that has resulted in temporizing delays which can only guarantee a fatal outcome.

The probabilities of access and the distribution of each data-item's length are assumed to be known, and to be mutually independent. The file system uses one or more storage devices, and each record may be partitioned into subrecords that are stored on different devices. One of the subrecords is designated as the primary record; when a request for a record is made, the primary record is first accessed, and other subrecords are accessed only if the pertinent information is not stored in the primary record. The model that is presented in this paper, both as a nonlinear programming model and a mixed integer programming model, is a very general one; several types of file systems may be derived from it by an appropriate selection of its parameters.

The needs of these types of users have influenced the organization and make-up of this volume, in that the requirements of the first two groups have made the manual more comprehensive than it might have been if intended for a textbook only, while the introductions to sections and many of the annotations have been provided particularly for the library school student.

A crucial axiom provides for the use of auxiliary variables, which are added to a parallel program as an aid to proving it correct. The information in a partial correctness proof can be used to prove such properties as mutual exclusion, freedom from deadlock, and program termination.

3168,"Capability-Based Addressing Various addressing schemes making use of segment tables are examined. The inadequacies of these schemes when dealing with shared addresses are explained. These inadequacies are traced to the lack of an efficient absolute address for objects in these systems. The direct use of a capability as an address is shown to overcome these difficulties because it provides the needed absolute address.  Implementation of capability-based addressing is discussed.  It is predicted that the use of tags to identify capabilities will dominate. A hardware address translation scheme which never requires the modification of the representation of capabilities is suggested. The scheme uses a main memory hash table for obtaining a segment's location in main memory given its unique code. The hash table is avoided for recently accessed segments by means of a set of associative registers. A computer using capability-based addressing may be substantially superior to present systems on the basis of protection, simplicity of programming conventions, and efficient implementation. ",cacm

(2) when the walls of the peripheral capillary loops are thickened by voluminous amyloid deposits, the hyaline aspect of the primitive basal membrane persists, but its structure is altered by the presence of multiple amyloid fibrils. (3) on the other hand, in the initial stages, amyloid fibrils cannot be seen in the 'lamina densa' of the basal membrane; they only appear on the epithelial and endo- thelial surfaces of the membrane. this suggests that amyloidosis represents an abnormal precipitate of extrinsic origin, rather than a transformation 'in situ' of the basal membrane.

1786,"Computer Formulation of the Equations of Motion Using Tensor Notation A means is described for extending the area of application of digital computers beyond the numerical data processing stage and reducing the need for human participation in the formulation of certain types of computer problems. By the use of tensor calculus and a computer language designed to facilitate symbolic mathematical computation, a method has been devised whereby a digital computer can be used to do non-numeric work, that is, symbolic algebraic manipulation and differentiation. To illustrate the techniques involved, a digital computer has been used to derive the equations of motion of a point mass in a general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system.  Since this operation involves a formulation in terms of first- and second-order differential coefficients, it provides a good demonstration of a computer's capability to do non-numeric work and to assist in the formulation process which normally precedes the numerical data processing stage. Moreover, this particular problem serves to illustrate the advantages of the mathematical techniques employed.

4273,"Chemical Abstracts Index Names for Chemical Substances in the Ninth Collective Period (1972-1976)  Index names for chemical substances have been significantly revised by Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) for Volume 76 [January-June 1972, the first volume of the Ninth Collective Period (1972-1976)] and subsequent volumes of Chemical Abstracts. While remaining generally within the framework of IUPAC and other existing nomenclature rules, the most systematic recommended names have been chosen. These names are more easily derived from molecular structural diagrams, and, therefore, are more quickly found by index users. Machine editing of index names and translation of these names into structural representations in the CAS computer-based information system are also aided by the revisions. The index name revisions include (i) conversion of almost all ""trivial"" or author terminology into more systematic names, (ii) simplification of general name-selection rules, and (iii) elimination of special treatment for certain classes of substances. Specific identifiable alloys, elementary particles, enzymes, and mixtures of substances are now indexed like conventional chemical substances. Difficulties encountered with generation of previous Chemical Abstracts index names and indexing rules are described, and comparisons are made of new and former index names for chemical compounds and substituent radicals.

This procedure may be used for counting patterns on a matrix, and a hardware implementation of the algorithm using large scale integrated technology is envisioned. The principal features of this method are the very small window employed (two-by-two elements), the parallel nature of the process, and the possibility of shrinking any pattern, regardless of the complexity of its configuration. Problems regarding merging and disconnection of patterns during the process as well as the determination of the maximum number of steps necessary to obtain a single isolated element from a pattern, are reviewed and discussed. An analogy with a neural network description, in terms of McCulloch-Pitts ""neurons"" is presented. ",cacm

3399,"Annual Reviews of Information Science and Technology  In spite of concerns expressed in the literature about the health and vigor of the field of information science and of its service-oriented institutions - libraries and information centers - the progress reviews in this volume provide grounds for optimism. Some of the trends that were commented on in Volume 6 have proved to be solid and important. For example, the movement toward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases is not very strong, and it will probably not be many years before satisfying experience with this new mode of information access will help it become not merely an experimental innovation but the standard means of searching and using centrally (or regionally) held data. Three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects of the movement: Bennett's review of the user interface in interactive systems, Gechman's report on machine-readable bibliographic data bases, and Brandhorst and Eckert's review of document retrieval and dissemination systems.  This volume also introduces a new Annual Review topic of potentially great importance for future libraries: video cartridges and cassettes. It is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will, in the coming years, shift the balance of their holdings in the direction of some of the newer media, and the chapter by Kletter and Hudson helps to define the potential and problems of some of the promising new media. Other new areas of interest are information system applications in the criminal justice system and information system applications in the humanities.  In addition to these topics, this volume covers three of the core areas of information science, which we attempt to review on as close to an annual basis as possible: information needs and uses, document description and representation, and organization of information. This coverage is consistent with a newly developed Annual Review master plan for cyclic but flexible coverage of some 40 major areas of interest in library and information science. ",cisi

The notion of relevance is taken as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability.. The resulting technique called ""Probabilistic Indexing,"" allows a computing machine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inference and derive a number (called the ""relevance number"") for each document, which is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request ranked according to their probable relevance..   The paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library system the cross-referencing (""see"" and ""see also"") is based solely on the ""semantical closeness"" between index terms, statistical measures of closeness between index terms can be defined and computed.. Thus, given an arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant documents that would not otherwise have been selected..   Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user..

It is shown that the only statistic of HB[1] trees (AVL trees) that is a function of the size of the tree is the time to search for an item in the tree. For sufficiently large trees, the execution times of all procedures for maintaining HB[1] trees are independent of the size of the tree.  In particular, an average of .465 restructures are required per insertion, with an average of 2.78 nodes revisited to restore the HB[1] property; an average of  .214 restructures are required per deletion, with an average of 1.91 nodes revisited to restore the HB[1] property. Moreover,the execution times of procedures for maintaining HB[k] trees, for k>1, are also independent of the size of the tree except for the average number of nodes revisited on a delete operation in order to restore the HB[k] property on trace back.  The cost of maintaining HB[k] trees drops sharply as the allowable imbalance (k) increases.

In storing these structures, preserving logical adjacencies or ""proximity"" is usually an important consideration.  The combinatorial problem of storing arrays as various kinds of list structures is examined. Embeddings of graphs are used to model the loss of proximity involved in such storage schemes, and an elementary proof that arrays cannot be stored as linear lists with bounded loss of proximity is presented. Average loss of proximity is then considered, and it is shown that arrays cannot be stored as linear lists with only bounded loss of average proximity, but can be so stored in binary trees. The former result implies, for instance, that row major order is an asymptotically optimal storage strategy for arrays. ",cacm

Only theory relevant for such decision-makers is presented here. This means that the effects of computers on the economy as a whole lie outside the scope of this book, as do a number of related issues. We deal, thus, with microeconomic, not macroeconomic, theory: our focus is on the small (industry, firm, computer) and not the large (gross national product, consumer price index, unemployment).

3953,"Relevance Predictability in Information Retrieval Systems  An experiment is described which attempts to derive quantitative indicators regarding the potential relevance predictability of the intermediate stimuli used to represent documents in information retrieval systems. In effect, since the decision to peruse an entire document is often predicated upon the examination of one ""level of processing"" of the document (e.g., the citation and/or abstract), it became interesting to analyze the properties of what constitutes ""relevance"". However, prior to such an analysis, an even more elementary step had to be made, namely, to determine what portions of a document should be examined.  An evaluation of the ability of intermediate response products (IRPs), functioning as cues to the information content of full documents, to predict the relevance determination that would be subsequently made on these documents by motivated users of information retrieval systems, was made under controlled experimental conditions. The hypothesis that there might be other intermediate response products (selected extracts from the document i.e., first paragraph, last paragraph, and the combination of first and last paragraph), that would be representative of the full document as the traditional IRPs (citation and abstract) was tested systematically. The results showed that:   1. there is no significant difference among the several IRP treatment     groups on the number of cue evaluations of relevancy which match     the subsequent user relevancy decision on the document;   2. first and last paragraph combinations have consistently predicted     relevancy to a higher degree that the other IRPs;   3. abstracts were undistinguished as predictors; and   4. the apparent high predictability rating for citations was not     substantive.  Some of these results are quite different than would be expected from previous work with unmotivated subjects. ",cisi

6651,"cognitive functioning in early infantile autism: an examination of four cases by means of the wechsler intelligence scale for children the results are communicated which were obtained from an examination, by means of the wechsler intelligence scale for children, of four cases of early infantile autism. these cases had developed in such a way that a reliable investigation by means of a mental test had become possible. according to their full scale iq's the four cases fell within the category of dull normal intelligence or less. all of them showed a considerable discrepancy between the verbal and the performance iq, the performance iq being of much higher value. the composition of the autistic test profiles was characterized by a large variability in the subtest scores, discriminating the autistic group significantly from non-autistic control groups. the subtest score divergencies, responsible for the large variability, showed a distinct pattern, being specific for the autistic group as a whole. this group could be considered as a distinct group particularly by a marked tendency to achieve poorly and far below the subject's average level in the subtests comprehension and vocabulary, and to achieve superiorly and far above that level in the subtests block design and object assembly. by specifying the mental functions, conditional for success in these four subtests that occupy extreme positions within the autistic test profiles, it was concluded that the autistic patients apparently were able to achieve well, or even superiorly, only if the task could be performed on a purely perceptual level. but they failed as soon as an appeal was made to thinking proper. this was thought to be due to a disability in dealing with imaginary things and imaginary situations, or, in other words, to an incapability to objectify what is not actually present in the subject's concrete situation. it is proposed that this impairment could be reduced to a lack of symbolic means, being the correlate of a defective or insufficiently developed language in the patients. it is further proposed that children suffering from early infantile autism might not be able, or at a later stage only, to reach that level of language development in which words can be used as symbols, representing absent things and absent situations.

(the therapeutic value of their increase after calciferol) quantitative determination of the urinary steroids in 38 patients with extensive ul- cero-caseous pulmonary tb confirmed that the 17-ketosteroids are always decreased in these cases. calciferol, in the form of one ampoule of vit. d2 of 600,000 u. every 10 days, in combination with active tuberculostatic drugs, in the majority of the cases leads to an increase of the urinary 17-ketosteroids from 50 to 100% in 2 mth. it appears that the calciferol exerts its action through proteolysis; it stimulates the liquefaction and evacuation of the caseous material. this proteolytic effect is related to that of the mineralocorticoids, which are phlogistic and proteolytic sub- stances. calciferol offers the advantage over these substances that it does not affect the electrolytes and is well tolerated by the organism. for this reason, good results may be expected from its administration in cases of extensive pulmonary tb, in which the myc. tuberculosis has remained sensitive to the administered tuberculostic drugs but nevertheless does not proceed towards recovery because of the marked caseous lesions. in such cases calciferol treatment leads to a rapid and pronounced decrease of the radiological shadows, improves the general condition and also modifies the steroid metabolism rendered abnormal by the disease.

4601,"Abstracting Concepts and Methods    Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a how-to-do-it course. It should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts, the historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishing industry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in the preparation and evaluation of the product. These topics we call concepts.    The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing various types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications. These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the appendix. There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications.    Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the past. Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship. Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of computer-prepared abstracts and extracts. Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text, select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts. The benefits of this research are discussed.   Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry. Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or volunteer workers. Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information.

First, the range of complexity of an environment is greatly increased while the visible complexity of any given scene is kept within a fixed upper limit. Second, a meaningful way is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in a scene. Third, ""clipping"" becomes a very fast logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment within the field of view. Fourth, frame to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical ""working set,"" or fraction of the total structure that should be present in primary store for immediate access by the visible surface algorithm. Finally, the geometric structure suggests a recursive descent, visible surface algorithm in which the computation time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene. ",cacm

2334,"Optimal Shift Strategy for a Block-Transfer CCD Memory For the purposes of this paper, a block-transfer CCD memory is composed of serial shift registers whose shift rate can vary, but which have a definite minimum shift rate (the refresh rate) and a definite maximum shift rate. The bits iin the shift registers are numbered 0 to N - 1, and blocks of N bits are always transferred, always starting at bit 0.  What is the best shift strategy so that a block transfer request occurring at a random time will have to wait the minimal amount of time before bit 0 can be reached?  The minimum shift rate requirement does not allow one to simply ""park"" at bit 0 and wait for a transfer request. The optimal strategy involves shifting as slowly as possible until bit 0 is passed, then shifting as quickly as possible until a critical boundary is reached, shortly before bit 0 comes around again.  This is called the ""hurry up and wait"" strategy and is well known outside the computer field.

4027,"Categories and Relators: A New Scheme  If the (major) premise is accepted, that fully effective machine-strategization of a retrieval system depends upon the use of a (hierarchically) structural (but highly flexible) notation as the equivalent for the verbal access provided by either unitermic or articulated conceptual indicators, a faceted classification logically emerges as the desideratum.  The two aspects of a structural notation most determinative here are hierarchicality and uniform use of general categories (the latter, not merely for the sake of uniformity as such, but as the means to a heightened flexibility). These desiderata could of course be present on the ""idea plane"" alone; but without their being present notationally they do not furnish, to a mechanized retrieval system, the type of assistance it requires for optimal functioning.  The second (minor) premise ought to be that the Universal Decimal Classification, being both hierarchical and general-categoric, provides the desired structurality. But the melancholy fact is that this desideratum is not always satisfied, for instance when UDC uses direct division of a hierarchy when division by general category would be equally appropriate.

2060,"Incorporating Origin Shifts into the QR Algorithm for Symmetric Tridiagonal Matrices The QR iteration for the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix can be accelerated by incorporating a sequence of origin shifts. The origin shift may be either subtracted directly from the diagonal elements of the matrix or incorporated by means of an implicit algorithm. Both methods have drawbacks: the direct method can unnecessarily degrade small eigenvalues, while the implicit method can effectively loose the shift and thereby retard the convergence. This paper presents a new method which has neither drawback. ",cacm

(1) does the combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far downstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear and what is the detailed process of development . since the hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition always takes place at some point of the stream . however, when the temperature of the hot stream drops below a certain value, the distance required for ignition increases so enormously that it essentially does not occur in a physical apparatus of finite dimension . the complete development of the laminar flame front is computed using an approximation similar to the integral technique introduced by von karman into boundary layer theory .

2924,"On the Conversion of Decision Tables to Computer Programs The use of execution time diagnostics in pinpointing ambiguities in decision tables is discussed. It is pointed out that any attempt at resolving ambiguities at compile time will, in general, be impossible. It is shown that, as a consequence, tree methods of converting decision tables to programs are inadequate in regard to ambiguity detection. Two algorithms for programming decision tables whose merits are simplicity of implementation and detection of ambiguities at execution time are presented. The first algorithm is for limited entry decision tables and clarifies the importance of proper coding of the information in the decision table. The second algorithm programs a mixed entry decision table directly without going through the intermediate step of conversion to a limited entry form, thereby resulting in storage economy. A comparison of the algorithms and others proposed in the literature is made. Some features of a decision table to Fortran IV translator for the IBM 7044 developed by the authors are given. ",cacm

6321,"1021. left ventricular angiocardiography in the study of ventricular septal defects sixty-five cases of ventricular septal defect were studied by left angiocardiography. the left ventricle was entered by retrograde arterial catheterization with a catheter having a j-shaped tip. this procedure appears to be little, or no more, hazardous than right-sided angiocardiography. ventricular septal defects may be divided into 5 types, depending on their location in the ventricular septum. the anatomic and radiological features of the septum and septal defects are described. selective in- jection of contrast material into the left ventricle opacifies the blood passing through the defect in the septum and permits preoperative localization of the defect in rela- tion to identifiable anatomic landmarks. multiple defects of the septum are well de- monstrated. such information may be of considerable value to the surgeon under- taking repair of the septum. left ventriculography, often combined with supraval- vular aortography, has been used, when indicated, to differentiate between mitral insufficiency and ventricular septal defect and in the detection of other cardiac ano- malies whose manifestations are marked by those of the septal lesion. this tech- nique is well suited to the postoperative study of patients following repair of the septal defect and for follow-up studies in patients not operated upon to clarify the natural history of defects in different portions of the ventricular septum.

4493,"Education and Manpower for Librarians  This paper is not an official policy statement of the American Library Association nor of the Office for Library Education. It is simply an exploration, an outline of possibilities for consideration by the profession. Its purpose is to generate discussion that will lead eventually to a statement of Association policy that the profession will support and make effective.  A basic assumption on which the statement rests is this: that the library occupation is much broader than that segment of it which is the library profession, but that the professional segment has responsibility for the definition and supervision of the training and education required by the complete range of activities encompassed by the occupation. Librarians are not the only persons who work in libraries, but librarians are the ones who are concerned with the advancement and improvement of the library profession. It follows then that it is the obligation of the professionals to engage actively in the establishment and maintenance of standards and norms governing the preparation of people who work at any level in libraries. They should define and guide the kinds of preparation most useful at the pre-professional level and not merely the education of those who will hold positions at the level we now call ""professional.""

1555,"An Interpretive Input Routine for Linear Programming In this descriptive article an input code is presented which greatly simplifies data input to any linear programming solution routine, for subsequent use either as a pedagogical device or for solving rather small LP problems. This latter (limited) use derives not at all from inherent limitations in the code itself, but from an efficiency evaluation: large LP problems would doubtless benefit from an input system more suited for bulk data handling than the input code described. From a user's standpoint, input appears almost exactly as a textbook presentation of the LP problem (limited only by a keypunch's inability to write subscripts, etc.). The input interpreter scans column wise, thus no fixed format data preparation is required. The user may also, under very general requirements only, liberally use editorial comments throughout the input deck as an aid in identification, e.g., of row constraints.  The article includes examples of input, output from a solution routine presently in use, and a skeleton flowchart of the input interpreter. ",cacm

4631,"A Regional Network - Ohio college Library Center  The Ohio College Library Center is developing a computerized, user-oriented, library system that will improve efficiency of library use and operations; that will increase availability of library resources within a region; and that will facilitate evolution of new and easier accesses to information in libraries. The center does not conceive of its task as being merely the mechanization of library procedures of the past.  For the immediate future, the principal academic objective of the center is to increase the availability of library resources for use in educational and research programs in colleges and universities throughout Ohio. A more distant objective is to enable libraries to participate actively in the programs of instruction and research in their institutions. The passive service functions that libraries have developed during the past century are proving inadequate to meet the present demands made of libraries, and will be increasingly inadequate in the future.  The per-student costs of libraries are rising somewhat more than twice as rapidly as unit-cost rises in the general economy. Therefore, the principal economic goal of the Ohio College Library Center is to decelerate the rate of rise of per-student costs, so that the rate of increase will approximate that of the economy as a whole.

3069,"Two-Level Control Structure for Nondeterministic Programming The basic ideas of nondeterministic programming are critically reconsidered to single out a proper attitude and programming style for language allowing direct control of nondeterministic features.  The proposed attitude aims at retaining the purity of the nondeterministic formulation of search processes on one level (the attempt level), deferring the coordination of problem solving efforts to another (the choice level). The feasibility of recognizing these two levels is discussed, stressing that the structure to be managed at the choice level is a free of contexts.  The leaves are computational environments, each holding an alternative under inspection, while the other nodes are associated with choice poin ts.  According to the proposed programming style, a generative function is associated with each choice poin t, which expresses the desired choice strategy. The main advantage on this approach is the localization of the search strategies: Each nonterminal node of the tree keeps track of the state of the computation as it was when the choice poin t was last interrogated, holding at the same time the strategy to coordinate the available alternatives. Examples are given in term of ND-Lisp, an extension of Lisp designed and implemented according to these guidelines. ",cacm

For identification of information the paper suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed in a paper by Goffman, Verhoeff and Belzer) associated with an object language be used. For searching strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function of relevancy is developed which rewards the system for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving the nonrelevant, and penalizes the system for the escaped relevant documents and false drops. The inadequacies of a linear model are indicated. Two approaches to file organization are discussed. One is self-organization of the file based on its history and past performance, and the second is a self-generating subset of the file with a high probability of being relevant. ",cacm

1312,Procedure-Oriented Language Statements to Facilitate Parallel Processing Two statements are suggested which allow a programmer writing in a procedure-oriented language to indicate sections of program which are to be executed in parallel. The statements are DO TOGETHER and HOLD. These serve partly as brackets in establishing a range of parallel operation and partly to define each parallel path within this range. DO TOGETHERs may be nested. The statements should be particularly effective for use with computing devices capable of attaining some degree of compute-compute overlap. ,cacm
7090,"an electron microscopic study of developing gall bladder epithelium in the rabbit the gall bladder epithelium of the adult rabbit consists of two types of cells. the first and more common type shows features associated with absorption, notably microvilli, limited pinocytosis, some lysosomes and an elaboration of the lateral cell membrane and intercellular spaces. the mitochondria are concentrated in a subapical band. the second and more infrequent type is a dark rod-shaped cell of unknown function but which may be a dehydrated epithelial cell. foetal epithelial cells lack the functional adult characteristics; the mito- chondria are uniformly distributed. in addition they display basal granules and apical apocrine bullae. epithelial cell damage and white cell infiltration occurs between 24 days after birth or just after. just before birth some epithelial cells are very large and pale with smooth outlines, others are more dense and display vigorous pinocytosis. adult characteristics are acquired at or immediately after birth and pino- cytosis subsides. it is believed that water resorption occurs before the functional changes which allow continuous passage of water into the circulation.

1749,"Consumer Difficulties With Computerized Transactions: An Empirical Investigation The prevalence with which errors may be encountered by the end targets of a computerized process is assessed. How many and what type of errors occur? How easily are they corrected? What is the reaction of consumers to errors-to a failure to correct them? What can be learned by designers of large management packages from such data? Results show that with the present state of the art, approximately 40 percent of individuals (or households) having average contacts with different types of accounts experience one or more errors per year. Eighty percent relate to billing. Attempts to correct errors often turned out to be difficult and not always successful. There appears to be some conflict between computer-using organizations and their public. Also the role of poor man agement packages including poor software is indicated. While most management systems may be adequate, results of the survey raise concerns about the timeliness and the number of designs of very large linked program packages (as EFT for instance).  ",cacm
3529,"The Development of a Semantic Differential to Assess Users' Attitudes Towards An On-line Interactive Reference Retrieval System   A semantic differential (SD) is a commonly used instrument which can be used to reliably measure attitude toward a variety of objects or concepts.. Each SD consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales on which a respondent reacts, in relation to the object or concept of interest.. To interpret completed SDs, it simplifies the procedures and aids in the development of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or more independent clusters.. The primary purpose of this study was to identify those clusters (or dimensions) applied by a user of an on-line user-oriented reference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system..   Seventy-one who used or were familiar with a working on-line reference retrieval system completed a packet of 20 SDs, each consisting of the same 19 adjective scales.. The correlations among the scales were factor analyzed.. Three independent dimensions were identified.. Factor I was labeled ""evaluative-specific"" and accounted for over 23% of the total variance.. Factor II was called ""desirability""; it accounted for over 17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled ""enormity"" accounted for over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factor structure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived three dimensional structure underlies users' attitudes toward a more general class of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured system evaluation of users' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading..   In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjective scales were identified which best represented the three dimensions.. Brief instructions are included which outline how to use this SD.. The discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structure and the need for a predicative replication of the study..

6241,"volkmann's ischaemia volkmann's ischaemia is the name given to a sequence of events originally described by volkmann in 1881. basically the condition consists of the replacement of the limb flexor muscles by fibrous tissue following injury or occlusion of the main arterial supply of blood to these muscles. the condition is rare fortunately--mainly because of improved methods of prevention. the flexor muscles of the toes are sometimes affected, but the commonest group of muscles so damaged are the flexor muscles of the forearm. total arterial occlusion to a limb for several hours usually causes frank gangrene; partial or total occlusion for shorter periods may give rise to ischaemic contracture. the muscles, being deprived of their blood supply, die and are sub- sequently replaced by fibrous tissue. like all scars, the fibrous tissue contracts, producing the complete picture of volkmann's ischaemic contracture. the forearm is thin and wasted, and the fingers are held in flexion owing to the overall shortening of the flexor muscles. in severe cases, if the nerves are also affected or if the entire muscle mass is replaced by fibrosis, the fingers may be totally paralysed as well.

Important common features of list-processing languages are reviewed: forms of data structures which are manipulated, necessity for dynamic allocation of storage, use of pushdown stores, and use of recursive operations. Principal differences between the four languages under consideration are detailed: representations of data, both by the programmer and within the machine; methods for storage allocation; programming formalisms and special processes available, including arithmetic facilities; and usability in terms of availability, documentation, learning aids and debugging facilities. A rough comparison shows that all the languages discussed have approximately the same speed. Finally, the authors give some heuristics to aid in the selection of one of these languages for use in particular problem applications, concluding that no one of the languages considered is distinctly superior in all possible list-processing applications.

1514,"Subexpression Ordering in the Execution of Arithmetic Expressions An arithmetic expression can often be broken down into its component subexpressions. Depending on the hardware environment in which the expression is to be executed, these subexpressions can be evaluated in serials, in parallel, or in a combination of these modes. This paper shows that expression execution time can be minimized only if consideration is given to the ordering of the subexpressions. In particular, subexpressions should be executed in order of decreasing memory and processor time requirements. This observation is valid for configurations ranging from a uniprocessor with an unbuffered main memory to multiprocessor with a ""cache"" buffer memory. If the number of subexpressions which can be executed in parallel exceeds the number of available processors, then execution of some of these subexpressions must be postponed. A procedure is given which combines this requirement with the earlier ordering considerations to provide an optimal execution sequence. ",cacm

4229,"Synthesis, Identification and Control of Distributed Parameter Systems   Many synthesis, identification and control problems that arise in distributed parameter systems are studied.. Two major approaches, viz., the frequency domain approach and the time domain approach, are considered.. The techniques developed overcome many difficulties that are associated with optimization problems in distributed parameter systems..   In the frequency domain, distributed systems described by the general (linear) telegrapher's equations are considered, over a finite band of frequencies.. An electric network, equivalent to these systems, is developed.. Many optimization problems, that are of practical interest, are formulated in terms of this new equivalent network.. Some of the basic principles of lumped network theory are applied to formulate these optimization problems..  Many advantages in the method of solution due to this formulation are discussed..   In the time domain, a method of characteristics is developed as a method of solution for optimization problems.. First and second order hyperbolic systems are considered.. Imbedding and Gradient techniques developed along the characteristics are shown to have numerous computational advantages.. It is shown that solving for Green's function (and associated eigenvalue problem) is not required..   It is hoped that the methods developed here will lead efficiently to actual realization of optimal distributed systems.. ",cisi

Sometimes it seems as if the library world has divided into two camps; those who seem to know all about this thing called ""OCLC"" and who keep popping that rounded acronym into their conversation with a certain bromidic effervescence, and the other camp - plain folk who are happy to take library life one acronym at a time, as they need it, and who, if pressed, might guess that OCLC has something to do with, oh, Optical Codes at the Library of Congress?  Only in Ohio - where the Ohio College Library Center began and where this national, computerized, bibliographic data exchange continues to grow - is OCLC universally a library household term, even among computer-phobes. In Ohio, most librarians already realize the kind of thing going on at OCLC is not simply the building up of someone else's data base in little bits and bytes, but perhaps the biggest revolution in access to library collections since books were unchained from the shelves.

5800,"the use of models for the determination of critical flutter speeds . the use of models for the determination of critical flutter speeds . the use of model tests in the prediction of full-scale critical flutter speeds is now well established, and the technique of such tests is therefore worthy of discussion . in order to obtain critical speeds for the model within the speed range of ordinary wind tunnels it is necessary that the model should differ in some respect from a mere small suggested by mckinnon wood the modification of the model consists in a reduction of its effective stiffnesses . this method has the defect /in most cases probably not serious/ that the model experiment is conducted at a reynolds number much below that for full-scale . in the present paper it is pointed out that an alternative method of reducing the critical speed is to increase the mass loading of the model and to make the flutter tests in compressed air . * it is then quite feasible to reach the full-scale reynolds number . this method of reducing the critical speeds by a proportionate increase of all effective densities may also be combined with a reduction of the elasticity of the model . the relation of model and full-scale stresses at the critical flutter speeds is considered . where the reduction in critical speed is effected  by increase of density only, the model and full-scale stresses are equal . in a model of reduced elasticity the stresses in the wires are the same as for full-scale, whereas, the stresses in the spars are less  than for full-scale . this is in accord with the usual experience that the wires of such a model are the first parts of the structure to fail in a flutter . lastly, the influence of gravity on flutter is considered . this is negligibly small for full-scale, but not necessarily so for the model . gravitational effects can sometimes be corrected by suitable orientation  of the model .

3667,"Rules for a Dictionary Catalog   No code of cataloging could be adopted in all points by every one, because the libraries for study and the libraries for reading have different objects, and those which combine the two do so in different proportions. Again, the preparation of a catalog must vary as it is to be manuscript or printed, and, if the latter, as it is to be merely an index to the library, giving in the shortest possible compass clues by which the public can find books, or is to attempt to furnish more information on various points, or finally is to be made with a certain regard to what may be called style. Without pretending to exactness, we may divide dictionary catalogs into short-title, medium title, and full-title or bibliographic; typical examples of the three being, 1, the Boston Mercantile (1869) or the Cincinnati Public (1871); 2, the Boston Public (1861 and 1866), the Boston Athenaeum (1874-82); 3, the catalog now making by the Library of Congress. To avoid the constant repetition of such phrases as ""the full catalog of a large library"" and ""a concise finding-list,"" I shall use the three words Short, Medium, and Full as proper names, with the preliminary caution that the Short family are not all the same size, that there is more than one Medium, and that Full may be Fuller and Fullest. Short, if single-columned, is generally a title-a-liner; if printed in double columns, it allows the title occasionally to exceed one line, but not, if possible, two; Medium does not limit itself in this way, but it seldom exceeds four lines, and gets many titles into a single line.

In attempting to solve these linear programming models, using IBM's MPS package, instances of cycling were encountered.  Small perturbations in the input data resulted in problems which did not cycle. This fact, plus several other observed phenomena suggest that the primary reason that cycling is not known to occur more frequently is the round-off errors in the computations perturb the problem sufficiently to prevent cycling (or at least to prevent indefinite cycling). In one case maximizing and minimizing an objective function subject to the same constrain t set was attempted, but MPS solved only one of these while giving an indication of infeasibility for the other.

The primary test data are summarized as statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents in the test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of the mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents.. A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library, as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded by its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection, processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gain realized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particular library, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variables can be calculated easily from the capability measures and the status statistics.. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictions of basic capability from collection size.. The most important result of this work is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decision aids in managing a basic library service.. A program of periodic surveys and further development of DDT's is recommended as appropriate for the Medical Library Association.. ",cisi

1701,"On Simulating Networks of Parallel Processes in Which Simultaneous Events May Occur Some of the problems of simulating discrete event systems, particularly computer systems, on a conventional digital computer are dealt with. The systems are assumed to be described as a network of interconnected sequential processes. Briefly reviewed are the common techniques used to handle such simulations when simultaneous events do not occur, can be ignored, or can be handled by simple priority rules. Following this, the problem of dealing with simultaneous events in separate processes is introduced.  An abstraction of this problem is developed which admits solution for a majority of commonly encountered problems. The technique will either find a method of simulating the parallel events or report that none can be found. In some of the latter cases it is shown to be possible to find a solution by extending the information available to the solution technique, but in many cases the technique becomes computationally unfeasible when the additional information is provided.

Applying a decomposition approach and treating the closed system as a single server, the response times in an open system with external arrivals are studied. The object is to investigate the effect of the memory alocation parameters on the expected response times under the two algorithms. Numerical solutions and economical lower bounds for the expected response times as functions of the control parameters are obtained.

3702,"IFLA - Communications - FIAB  The traditional pattern of organization of national and university libraries, apart from those in Germany or affected by German practice, was imposed by the weight given to the processing divisions.. The order department, which in university libraries did not include experts in book-selection, was not considered to be of comparable importance with the major department -- the cataloguing room, which also housed the classifiers.. Other divisions would be concerned with particular types of material -- maps, state papers or official documents, manuscripts, oriental books -- and would be largely autonomous with regard to acquisition and cataloguing.. The reading room staff were mainly employed in assisting readers to use the catalogue and in answering queries of a very specialized nature on the library's collections, especially on manuscripts or early printed books: they rarely dealt with the general bibliographical or reference type of enquiry which is put to present-day reference librarians.. In these circumstances members of staff tended to become expert in the work of their own department and not be invited to take any part in the activities of another.. Divisions between the various kinds of work were therefore hard and fast and the structure of the library's organization could become similarly rigid.. It must be appreciated that this is a generalization and that many libraries were more fluid in their approach. Nonetheless this conservative view of the library's function tended to freeze the administration into this form.. An expert in a particular subject field often undertook research in the subject outside the library and might occasionally be asked to deal with a reader enquiring about an aspect of his field, but usually he would not make much use of his expertise in connection with his library duties, unless of course he was appointed as a paleographer, orientalist or linguist.   The appointment of subject specialists may therefore necessitate a complete re-modelling of the staff organization if their influence is to extend beyond the bounds of the old departments. ",cisi

However, it is also suitable for other kinds of libraries, and the Interview Guide and Checklist can be used for a self-survey by library stuff.. In addition to survey use, the inventory has a variety of educational, administrative, managerial, and research applications.. A methods for weighting the categorical inventory data to reflect the relative desirability of different policies makes it possible to calculate scores indicating how a library's policies compare with those of an ""optimal"" library..

If the solution of the above equation for Zm, Zm=N(Z1,...;A1,...) gives rise to a function N which is nonlinear in the Ai, then one may rely on a version of Gaussian regression [1,2] for an iteration scheme that converges to a minimizing set of values. It is shown here that this same minimization technique may be used for the solution of simultaneous (not necessarily linear) equations. ",cacm

As a fuzzy relation, L is characterized by its membership function mL:T*U -> [0,1], which associates with each ordered pair (x,y) its grade of membership, mL(x,y), in L..   Given a particular x in T, the membership function mL(x,y) defines a fuzzy set, M(x), in U whose membership function is given by mM(x)(y) = mL(X,y).. The fuzzy set M(x) is defined to be the meaning of the term x, with x playing the role of a name for M(x)..   If a term x in T is a concatenation of other terms in T, that is, x = x1 ... xn, xi T, i epsilon 1,...,n, then the meaning of x can be expressed in terms of the meanings of x1,...,xn through the use of a lambda-expression or by solving a system of equations in the membership functions of the xi which are deduced from the syntax tree of x..

4443,"A Core Medical Library for Practitioners in Community Hospitals  In a ongoing study designed in part to evaluate and encourage continuing education programs in community hospitals Postgraduate Medical Institute (PMI) has determined that there is need for guidance in the area of medical-library development. Reports from PMI physician consultants who visited more than 40 community hospitals indicate that medical-library facilities are generally poor and infrequently used by physicians. The basic weaknesses of these libraries fall into four categories: inadequate collections, inadequate personnel, inadequate space, and the absence of any practical indexing system to facilitate use of collections that do exist.  Failure to deal with these problems does not reflect lack of interest but rather lack of stimulation to do so and absence of any concerted source of guidance. In response to requests for such guidance PMI has undertaken a community hospital library development project in co-operation with the New England Regional Medical Library Service (NERMLS) at the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine. This report is concerned with the first phase of this project - namely, the formulation of a list consisting of a minimal number of textbooks and journals that can function as the core for a medical library.  Explanatory letters and questionnaires were sent to 400 specialists representing 50 areas of medical practice, including the basic sciences.

(c) cross-classification: a concept may be considered in such a way that it     fits as logically into one discipline as another..

The approach now considered is from an organized universe of concepts, every concept being set down only once in an appropriate vocabulary, where it acquires the notation which identifies it wherever it is used.. It has been found that all the concepts present in any compound subject can be handled as though they belong to one of two basic concept types, using either Entitles or Attributes.. In classing, these concepts are identified, and notation is selected from appropriate schedules.. Subjects are then built according to formal rules, the final class number incorporating operators which convey the fundamental relationships between concepts..   Fron this viewpoint, the Rules and Operators of the proposed system can be seen as the grammar of an IR language, and the schedules of Entitles and Attributes as its vocabulary.. ",cisi

Each data string with the structured data environment (data bank) is explicitly or implicitly related to a format declaration residing in a format library. The processing mechanics associated with data string manipulation is developed in accordance with a generalized data filtering concept.  This results in the implementation of a two-part data filter module that satisfies internal processing functions by filtering data strings through format declarations associated with its input and output ports. ,cacm

The representation, which has practical storage requirements, provides a rapid mean of searching large files for data associated with geometric position as well as with attribute value. An application of this representation to handling terrain information illustrates its utility. The algebraic properties of the data structure make it computationally easy to determine whether a point lies within a closed boundary; compute the area contained by a closed boundary; generate the closed boundary representing the union or intersection of two closed boundaries; and determine the neighboring boundaries to a point and the minimum distances between them and the point.

3660,"Functional Approach  The present book sums up a certain stage in the research on algebraic linguistics being pursued at Charles University, Prague. It is based mainly on P. Sgall's book (1967a, in Czech), which represents the first attempt at a systematic formulation of the conception of generative description that has gradually been elaborated by our research group.  We do not claim that any particular question has been answered here in a definitive way, but the conception of a generative system based on an articulation of the semantic relation (see Section 1.3.4) may perhaps be interesting in connection with the present development of algebraic linguistics. This conception originated in 1963-1964, mainly as a reaction to the existing form of transformational description. It has not yet been possible to take the more recent impulses into account to an extent that would be adequate to their scope and theoretical significance. Only some aspects of these impulses are commented on in the relevant parts of the present book. We do not present a complete characterization of a system that could be regarded as a counterpart to the new version of transformational grammar. We have simply tried to formulate a conception that can serve as a starting point for the development of a new alternative. ",cisi

As an application of this principle to the search of pertinent items in a literature file, the file items should be arranged in decreasing order of the probability that an item will yield the information sought.. Complete ordering in this manner may not be feasible, and it is proposed that the files be partially ordered in search zones with some loss in search efficiency.. A model for assessing the relative efficiency for partial ordering is developed and used to determine optimal zone sizes under an assumed target distribution pattern.. In this way, trade-off between file organization effort and search effort can be meaningfully evaluated.. A representative target distribution function for search literature appears to follow the Bradford law of scattering.. This function is used to demonstrate the application of the model over a meaningful range of parameters obtained from empirical studies.. It is shown that a good two-zone search plan to scientific literature is one in which 15-20% of the most useful documents are examined first..

The primitive patterns and primitive skeletons are described, as well as the principle which allow their elaboration in to more complicated patterns and skeletons.

3727,"Information, Mechanism, and Meaning  In a day when it is hard enough in most fields of science to keep abreast of new and non-redundant literature, the publication of collected papers, like the estate of holy matrimony, is something not to be undertaken 'unadvisedly, lightly or wantonly'. In the present case it would not have been considered at all but for the kindly initiative of my respected friend Professor Roman Jakobson, whose persistent encouragement alone overcame that distaste which most of us feel for our ten- to twenty-year-old productions and brought this first volume to the point of no return. It is true that these exploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionably awkward selection of publications for anyone wanting to follow them up. On the other hand, as most of them were written for specific occasions, each of which demanded some rehearsal of points covered in earlier essays, the resulting repetitiveness presented a special problem. With occasional exceptions, redundancy could have been eliminated only at the cost of mutilating individual papers. The solution adopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passages intact, offsetting in small print those that can be skipped without loss by readers of the earlier chapters. Where some comment has seemed necessary, by way of foreword or postscript to the original papers, the passages added have been italicized. ",cisi

6617,"1959. analysis of mechanism of immunosuppressive drugs in renal homotransplantation dammin g. j. a long-term study of the mechanism of action of immunosuppressive drugs has been completed in bilaterally nephrectomized dogs with kidney homotransplants. over 1,000 test animals with 24 different drug protocols have been analyzed. increasing numbers of long surviving animals have posed many questions regarding the status treated host. the current drug protocol of azathioprine and diazoacetylserine ('azaserine') has produced 90% 50-day survivors and 50% 100-day survivors. the following observations have been documented all animals on prolonged drug therapy are immunologically competent; drug therapy can be stopped successfully in some but not all animals; long surviving kidneys apparently are protected in some way in the new environment because a second donor kidney can be rejected while the first survives; retransplantation of a long surviving kidney back to its original host did not lead to a decrease in renal function; long surviving kidneys successfully retransplanted back to their original donors are rejected when transplanted to third party, non-drug treated recipients; immune paralysis does not account for the prolonged survival because the second donor kidney which constitutes a double dose of antigen is rejected while the first continues to survive; absorption or metabolism of the drug does not account for the variation in results because two kidneys, each from separate donors, can be rejected differentially in the same drug treated host; and all hosts are sensitized against the recipient and this sensitization continues even in those animals successfully weaned from drugs. additional analyses of the relationship of skin homografts and kidney homografts reveal the following skin homografts are universally rejected within 20 days by hosts treated with the drug regimen which protects kidney homografts sometimes permanently. when skin and kidney homografts from the same donor are placed simultaneously skin survival is prolonged while kidney survival is shortened. this paradoxical effect probably is explained by the production of antibodies by skin which are absorbed by the rejecting kidney. additional observations indicate that drug-treated animals, male and female, are fertile and that multiple rejection processes can produce generalized immunological picture in the host similar to an autoimmune disease process.

1225,"A Case Study of a New Code Generation Technique for Compilers Recent developments in optimizing techniques have allowed a new design for compilers to emerge.  Such a compiler translates the parsed source code into lower level code by a sequence of steps. Each step expands higher level statements into blocks of lower level code and then performs optimizations on the result. Each statement has only one possible expansion-the task of tailoring this code to take advantage of any special cases is done by the optimizations.  This paper provides evidence that this strategy can indeed result in good object code. The traditionally difficult PL/I concatenate statement was investigated as a detailed example. A set of fairly simple optimizations was identified which allow the compiler to produce good code. More elaborate optimizations can further improve the object code.  For most contexts of the concatenate statement, the code produced by a compiler using the expansion-optimization strategy described above compares favorably with the code produced by a conventional PL/I optimizing compiler.

The model first applies syntactic analysis to eliminate some interpretations and then employs a simplified semantic intersection procedure to find a valid interpretation of the input. While the semantic processing is similar to TLC's, the syntactic component includes the early use of parse trees and special purpose rules. The ""relational triple"" notation used during interpretation of input is compatible with MUSE's memory structures, allowing direct verification of familiar concepts and the addition of new ones. MUSE also has a repertoire of actions, which range from editing and reporting the contents of its own memory to an indirect form of question answering.

4219,"The Development of a Scientific Specialty: The Phage Group and the Origins of Molecular Biology  This paper analyses the formation of a new discipline, molecular biology, from the development of phage work. It argues that such social variables as the competitive position and relative status of each of the specialities or disciplines from which a new one is formed are not sufficient to explain phage work's development into the specialty of molecular biology. Even though persons in physics, a field with high academic standing, decided to enter biology, which had a lower academic standing, and even though some recruiting of students occurred, these factors alone are not sufficient to account for the development of the specialty, particularly given the competitiveness of modern conditions. In the emergence of molecular biology from phage work, the variables of status and competitive position, adduced by Professors Ben-David and Collins to explain the emergence of experimental psychology from the hybridization of physiology and philosophy, seem to be less important than other normal activities which occur in scientific development.

2522,"Efficient Multiprogramming Resource Allocation and Accounting Although sometimes thought of as only a component of time-sharing operation, multiprogramming can involve broader questions of resource allocation, since fairness is not required to meet a response criterion. In a multiprogrammed system, it may serve maximal resource use to be unfair, for example by holding an input/output channel idle for a program while it completes a small amount of processor usage, enabling further use of the channel. Several applications of this principle are given, and it is suggested that a multiprogramming executive might dynamically adjust its allocation algorithms to gain efficiency. Allocation of resources is closely connected to accounting for those resources, raising the problems of repeatability, minimal uncharged overhead, and relative weighting of charges for dependent resources. Since weightings may depend on allocation algorithms, these are not arbitrary accounting parameters. Often the only repeatable accounting is one which omits an extensive overhead will be paid, and should multiprogramming prove efficient, overcharges will result. Multiprogramming turns on allocation of the memory resource essential to control of other resources. The general suggestions for allocation and accounting are applied to this question, and some details provided for the case of a monitor which controls a virtual-memory machine. ",cacm

A quick and effective means of acquainting them with the state-of-the-art was needed, but no convenient compilation of relevant material was available. It was agreed that a book on the theory and techniques of information storage and retrieval procedures would be a worthwhile project for the language processing staff to undertake. Although no one member could reasonably be expected to cover the entire range of technical developments in this field, the staff as a whole is concerned with most phases of the work.

It offers the potential of extremely reliable, extremely small, and, in some of its forms, extremely fast computers. If large-enough quantities can be built, this circuitry can become very low in cost.  On-line real-time computers. Computers capable of responding to many distant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to human thinking. They have the potential of bringing the power and information of innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home.  Picturephone. A public dial-up telephone system in which subscribers see as well as hear each other.  Large TV screens. TV screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary.  Cable TV. Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carrying capacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable. It could be used for signals other than television.  Voice answerback. Computers can now assembly human-voice words and speak them over the telephone. This fact, coupled with the Touchtone telephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal.

Implementation of the Philosophy   It was argued in Part I (see JASIS, March-April 1973 p. 87) that the best way to evaluate a retrieval system is, in principle at least, to elicit subjective estimates of the system's utility to its users, quantified in terms of the numbers of utilities (e.g. dollars) they would have been willing to give up in exchange for the privilege of using the system; and a naive methodology was outlined for evaluating retrieval systems on this basis.. But the impracticality of the naive evaluation procedure as it stands raises the questions:	How can one decide which practical measure is likely to yield results most closely resembling those of the naive methodology? And how can one tell whether the resemblance is close enough to make applying the measure worth while? In the present paper two kinds of solution to these problems are taken up..

(2) a girl of 1 yr and 4 mth had increasing jaundice since birth. autopsy revealed a hypoplastic common bile duct, which was, however, open to probing, and marked green coloration of the liver. also in this case, the bile ducts were very narrow and had solid ductular cell sprouts reaching the liver cells. this type of bile duct corresponds to a stage in ontogenesis and does not show signs of proliferation. it may be considered a form of hypoplasia, as the size and number of the primordial bile ducts is reduced. when present the anlage shows a regular connection with the liver cells. this hypoplasia is to be distinguished from an atresia. the long survival of the second case can be explained by the great compensatory capacity of the liver.

2725,"Design and Implementation of a Diagnostic Compiler for PL/I PL/C is a compiler for a dialect for PL/I. The design objective was to provide a maximum degree of diagnostic assistance in a batch processing environment.  For the most part this assistance is implicit and is provided automatically by the compiler. The most remarkable characteristic of PL/C is its perseverance-it completes translation of every program submitted and continues execution until a user-established error limit is reached. This requires that the compiler repair errors encountered during both translation and execution, and the design of PL/C is dominated by this consideration. PL/C also introduces several explicit user-controlled facilities for program testing.  To accommodate these extensions to PL/I without abandoning compatibility with IBM compiler PL/C permits ""pseudo comments""-constructions whose contents can optionally be considered either source test or comment.  In spite of the diagnostic effort PL/C is a fast and efficient processor. It effectively demonstrates that compilers can provide better diagnostic assistance than is customarily offered, even when a sophisticated source language is employed, and that this assistance need not be prohibitively costly.

4426,"Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis  Our purpose in writing this book has been to give a systematic account of major topics in pattern recognition, a field concerned with machine recognition of meaningful regularities in noisy or complex environments.  The most prominent domain-independent theory is classification theory, the subject of Part I of this book. Based on statistical decision theory, it provides formal mathematical procedures for classifying patterns once they have been represented abstractly as vectors.  Attempts to find domain-independent procedures for constructing these vector representations have not yielded generally useful results. Instead, every problem area has acquired a collection of procedures suited to its special characteristics. Of the many areas of interest, the pictorial domain has received by far the most attention. Furthermore, work in this area has progressed from picture classification to picture analysis and description. Part II of this book is devoted to a systematic presentation of these topics in visual scene analysis. ",cisi

(b) chronic infection could readily be established by in vitro infection and no cytopathic effect was noted. (c) although many strains continued to shed virus throughout months of in vitro cultivation, no changes in growth properties occurred with the exception that infected strains from lung tissue showed limited growth capacities. (d) from observations of over 2,000 metaphases, neither obvious chromosomal rearrangements nor non-disjunctional changes were observed in strains infected naturally or experimentally. (e) among 17 rubella abortion-derived cell strains there was a marked elevation in frequency of chromosome breakage in 3 instances (18%, 29%, 68%,). (f) a correlation between virus shedding in vitro and increased chromosome breakage was noted although this was not complete. (g) the combined average frequency of chromosome breakage in one set of 7 rubella-abortion strains was 18%; in the other set of 9 abortus strains, 9.8%. (h) similarly, a slight, but significant elevation in average chromosome break frequency (9.8%) was obtained in four cell strains which had been experimentally infected in vitro with rubella virus (uninfected cells: 5.2%). although effects upon the chromosomes were demonstrated, these were restricted to slight general elevations in frequency of breakage above normal values. very high increases in breaks were sporadic. it appears more likely that the general fetal abnormalities associated with rubella infection in vivo result from possible effects of the virus upon growth rather than from effects upon the chromosomes. however, the studies were restricted to fibroblasts cultured in vitro; and effects on other types of cells may have greater implications for this question.

3698,"A Scientific Theory of Classification and Indexing and Its Practical Application   A classification is a theory of the structure of knowledge.. From a discussion of the nature of truth, it is held that scientific knowledge is the only knowledge which can be regarded as true.. The method of induction from empirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification.. Items of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms, called isolates, and the relations between them, called operators.. It is shown that only four basic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, and causation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in a linear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutations of such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement of the first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given, and possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then be constructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form.. The nature of possible classifications is discussed.. It is claimed that such an inductively constructed classification is the only true representation of the structure of knowledge, and that these principles provide a simple technique for accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data, with complete flexibility..

A novel method is presented, which maps they hyperbolic frequency distribution of text characteristics onto a rectangular distribution. This is more suited to implementation on storage devices.  This method treats text as a string of characters rather than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are more even than those of word types.

The rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much simplified file organization and promises considerable cost advantages. ",cisi

4113,"A Guide to the Construction and Use of Special Schemes  The use of classification in libraries is traditional and its value is appreciated. For documentation and information retrieval in general, other techniques such as alphabetical indexing and machine selection are also available. That classification is of value in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is, however, made evident in two ways. First, to achieve consistency and subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selection designers of such retrieval systems find the need to introduce classificatory techniques. Second, there is a continuing demand for the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangement and cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensively cultivated fields of knowledge.  It is to help meet these demands, particularly the second, that this guide has been prepared. The techniques of detailed depth classification have been greatly developed during the past decade, and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than the traditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed. These developments have been reported mainly as research papers in a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarily difficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology. There is a need for a more simply written and more readily available practical guide to the use of the newer techniques of classification. ",cisi

1118,"Use of Tree Structures for Processing Files In data processing problems, files are frequently used which must both be searched and altered.  Binary search techniques are efficient for searching large files, but the associated file organization is not readily adapted to the file alterations. Conversely, a chained file allocation permits efficient alteration but cannot be searched efficiently. A file organized into a tree-like structure is discussed, and it is shown that such a file may both be searched and altered with times proportional to slog(s)N, where N is the number of file items and s is a parameter of the tree. It is also shown that optimizing the value of s leads to a search time which is only 25 per cent slower than the binary search. The tree organization employs two data chains and may be considered to be a compromise between the organizations for the binary search and the chained file. The relation of the tree organization to multidimensional indexing and to the trie structure is also discussed. ",cacm
1025,"Logic and Programming Languages Logic has been long in terested in whether answers to certain questions are computable in principle, since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of formalization. More recently, precise comparisons in the efficiency of decision methods have become available through the developments in complexity theory.  These, however, are applications to logic, and a big question is whether methods of logic have significance in the other direction for the more applied parts of computability theory. Programming languages offer an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization is well advanced; however, the semantical theory can hardly be said to be complete. Though we have many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging mathematical answers to these queries: What is a machine?  What is a computable process? How (or how well) does a machine simulate a process? Programs naturally enter in giving descriptions of processes.  The definition of the precise meaning of a program then requires us to explain what are the objects of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem) and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics).  So far the theories of automata and of nets, though most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic aspects. It would seem that the understanding of higher-level program features involves us with infinite objects and forces us to pass through several levels of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to the final simulation on a real machine. These levels can be made mathematically exact if we can find the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.  The experience of many independent workers with the method of data types as lattices (or partial orderings) under an information content ordering, and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the flexibility of this approach in providing definitions and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence on implementations. Nevertheless much remains to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say we have a unified theory. ",cacm

3247,"Standard Costing for Information Systems: Background to a Current Study  For some time past, interest has been developing within the Aslib Research Department in the problems of establishing standard costs for information systems. A literature search recently conducted by the Department (R. Reynolds) has revealed a scarcity of usable information on this subject: such data as is available is difficult to evaluate comparatively because of the differing definitions of the operations costed and of the terms used to describe them. It would seem, therefore, that a first step towards developing a costing method of widespread application would be the establishment of standard conventions for the analysis of information systems.  One might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs for these systems, namely: (a) General survey method: The overall costs of a large number of information   systems are broken down into a small number of categories, and analysed   for correlation (see, for example, C.J. Wessel et al). (b) In-depth study: A small number of systems are studied in detail in an   attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting   them.  In a current project, we are attempting to apply method (b) to the production of current-awareness bulletins. An outline of some of the preliminary work in this project follows. ",cisi

Analytical and simulation results are based on the model of the computer-communications system being an M/D/1 queue (the multiplexor) in tandem with a single exponential server (the computer).  Analytical results include a general description of the output process of an M/D/1 queue and the conditions under which this output process is approximately Poisson. ",cacm

4129,"Thesaurus Compilation Methods: A Literature Review  This review has been sponsored by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information and the end product of the complete research will be a thesaurus of management terms. Parallel research in the business management area and also supported by OSTI is being conducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School, and K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School of Business Studies. As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in the construction of a faceted classification scheme for management, this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizing faceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus.  A study of existing information retrieval systems in the management field has already been made, so a decision to adopt some form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed. Thus a comparative study of other systems will not be attempted. A decision has also already been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus, was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfield results that appear to provide evidence of the superiority of natural language over controlled vocabularies. This was primarily because these results were restricted to tests on an aeronautical collection, and it may well be that the natural language of this discipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which is certainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language of management. This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, who quotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organic chemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and social science (20 per cent).  Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov, Mastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipment available to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest.

Almost every new issue of a social science journal brings additional evidence of this heightened activity. A significant aspect of much of this development has been the devising and application of new quantitative measurement techniques.

A spanning tree is grown and the vertices examined in turn, unexamined vertices being stored in a pushdown list to await examination. One stage in the process is to take the top element v of the pushdown list and examine it, i.e. inspect all those edges (v,z) of the graph for which z has not yet been examined. If z is already in the tree, a fundamental cycle is added; if not, the edge (v,z) is placed in the tree. There is exactly one such stage for each of the n vertices of the graph. For large n, the store required in creases as n^2 and the time as n^g where g depends on the type of graph involved.  g is bounded below by 2 and above by 3, and it is shown that both bounds are attained.

A study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance assessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure retrieval effectiveness.. Using a collection of 1200 documents in information science for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in the relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall and precision..

749,The Choice of Reference Poin ts in Best-Match File Searching Improvements to the exhaustive search method of best-match file searching have previously been achieved by doing a preprocessing step involving the calculation of distances from a reference poin t.  This paper discusses the proper choice of reference poin ts and extends the previous algorithm to use more than one reference poin t. It is shown that reference poin ts should be located outside of data clusters.  The results of computer simulations are presented which show that large improvements can be achieved by the proper choice and location of multiple reference poin ts. ,cacm

Perhaps more importantly, it provides connections between raw, multivariant data and sought-for information without making restrictive assumptions about the underlying statistics of the data. The general problem has been stated as follows. Given a collection of objects and a list of measurements made on each object, is it possible to find and/or predict a property of the objects that is not directly measurable but is known to be related to the measurements via some unknown relationship? The only assumption made is that similarities and dissimilarities among objects are reflected in at least some of the measurements. ",cisi

Following a brief description of standard list structures with single-word items, the multiword items are introduced. Then variable-length items are described, along with the corresponding space-utilization problems. Finally, several examples are given to illustrate the use of multiword lists.

1421,"Optimum Merging from Mass Storage An algorithm is displayed which yields the merge orders such that the total read time, defined to be the sum of seek time plus data-transfer time, is minimized for a sort using mass storage. The analysis is parameterized in terms of the ratio of seek time to the time it takes to fill available core with records, and the file size in units of core lengths; and thus it can be applied to any conventional CPU/mass storage combination. An explicit formula for total read time is derived, in terms of the parameters, which correlates very well with the total read time calculated using the optimum merge orders yielded by the algorithm. The formula involves the roots of a simple transcendental equation. A short table of these roots is included. Numerical results are graphically displayed for a wide range of the parameters. It is found that the normalized read time for optimum merging on a given hardware configuration is proportional to the file length times the logarithm of the file length. ",cacm

Because of the anticipatory nature of the I/O scheduling, these algorithms are restricted to classes of programs with predictable behavior. While the methods are not restricted to numerical computations, matrix and partial differential equation methods are typical examples of their use. It is shown that latency may be masked using a small amount of buffer memory. The methods discussed are independent of the overall size of the data base being considered. ",cacm

Once all the factors have been ascertained, a sequencing procedure is applied which orders the factors and expressions such that all information is computed in the correct sequence and factors need be retained in memory a minimal amount of time. An assignment algorithm is then executed in order to minimize the total number of temporary storage cells required to hold the results of evaluating the factors. In order to make these techniques computationally feasible, heuristic procedures are applied, and hence global optimal results are not necessarily generated. The factorization algorithms are also applicable to the problem of factoring Boolean switching expressions and of factoring polynomials encountered in symbol manipulating systems. ",cacm

Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be ""signed"" using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in ""electronic mail"" and ""electronic funds transfer"" systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret prime numbers p and q.

This paper suggests an approach or point of view that might help this situation by providing a method of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a more convenient and meaningful manner. This paper also furnishes several examples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data that support these statements.  In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirements of workers in the field of science and technology, with no serious attempt made to include workers in other fields.

Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in military training when the ""real thing"" was either unavailable or too dangerous. In more recent times, these games have become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved. Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional men and women. One of the main causes of this ""game explosion"" has been the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology.

1856,"Analyzing English Syntax with a Pattern-Learning Parser A dependency analysis system based on pattern recognition and learning logic was developed to infer word classes and rules of syntactic combination from experience with text which had been analyzed.  The characteristics used to form word classes are the depth in the dependency tree of each word, the direction of its governor and the same features for each of its immediate neighbors. Syntactic rules of combination show the relation of a word to its governor in the depth pattern of the sentence. The system was tested on 400 elementary basic English sentences including 300 used earlier by Knowlton in a different learning parser of all 400 sentences. After experience with 300 sentences it was able to generalize with 77 percent accuracy to the next 100.  In accumulative learning trials after the first 200 sentences it averaged a probability of .9 for accurately parsing each new sentence it encountered.  It was concluded that the system is adequate for learning to parse the bulk of basic English but that further development is required before conclusions about its application to ordinary English can be stored.  The system is operational and available on the ARPA/SDC time-shared computing system. ",cacm

Y(m), (m >= O) where Z and Y(i) are intermediate symbols and c a terminal symbol. Since the predictive analyzer at Harvard uses a standard-form grammar, it can accept the language of any context-free Grammar G, given an equivalent standard-form grammar Gs. The structural descriptions SD(Gs,X) assigned to a given sentence X by the predictive analyzer, however, are usually different from the structural descriptions SD(G,X) assigned to the same sentence by the original context-free grammar G from which Gs is derived. In Section 1, an algorithm, originally due to Abbott is described standard-form grammar each of whose rules is in standard form, supplemented by additional information describing its derivation from the original context-free grammar. A technique for performing the SD(Gs,X) to SD(G,X) transformation effectively is also described. In section 2, the augmented predictive analyzer as a parsing algorithm for arbitrary context-free languages is compared with two other parsing algorithms: a selective top-to-bottom algorithm similar to Irons' ""error correcting parse algorithm"" and an immediate constituent analyzer which is an extension of Sakai-Cocke's algorithm for normal grammars.

3363,"A Fuzzy-Set-Theoretic Interpretation of Linguistic Hedges   A basic idea suggested in this paper is that a linguistic hedge such as very, more or less, much, essentially, slightly, etc. may be viewed as an operator which acts on the fuzzy set representing the meaning of its operand.. For example, in the case of the composite term very tall man, the operator very acts on the fuzzy meaning of the term tall man..   To represent a hedge as an operator, it is convenient to define several elementary operations on fuzzy sets from which more complicated operations may be built up by combination or composition.. In this way, an approximate representation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations as complementation, intersection, concentration, dilation, contrast intensification, fuzzification, accentuation, etc..   Two categories of hedges are considered.. In the case of hedges of Type I, e.g., very, much, more or less, slightly, etc., the hedge can be approximated by an operator acting on a single fuzzy set.. In the case of hedges of Type II, e.g., technically, essentially, practically, etc., the effect of the hedge is more complicated, requiring a description of the manner in which the components of its operand are modified.. If, in addition, the characterization of a hedge requires a consideration of a metric or proximity relation in the space of its operand, then the hedge is said to be of Type IP or IIP, depending on whether it falls into category I or II..   The approach is illustrated by constructing operator representations for several relatively simple hedges such as very, more or less, much, slightly, etc.. More complicated hedges whose effect is strongly context-dependent, require the use of a fuzzy-algorithmic mode of characterization which is more qualitative in nature than the approach described in the present paper..

1907,"A Heuristic Problem Solving Design System for Equipment or Furniture Layouts The Designer Problem Solver (DPS) demonstrates that the computer can perform simple design tasks. In particular, it designs furniture and equipment layouts. This task was chosen because it is simple, well defined, and characteristic of many design tasks in architecture, engineering, urban planning, and natural resource management. These space planning tasks usually involve manipulating two-dimensional representations of objects to create feasible or optimal solutions for problems involving topological and metric spatial constraints. The paper describes extensive tests performed on the program. DPS is a heuristic problem solver with a planning phase prefixed to it. It uses the planning process to give it a sense of direction, diagnostic procedures to locate difficulties, and remedial actions to recover from difficulties. It uses a convex polygon representation to accurately describe the objects and the layout. This representation allows topological and metric constraints to be tested and the design to be easily updated. DPS has been applied to 50 problems.  While it is slow and limited in scope, the ideas behind it are general. It demonstrates the need for selectivity in controlling search and the methods used to achieve it: task-specific information, planning, diagnostic procedures, remedial actions, and selective alternative generators.

The pressures are generated by many factors including the success of these tools in other fields and their adoption by the organizations supporting libraries, the increasingly explicit character of competition for funds at all levels, and the complexity and critical nature of decisions on the host of new options being created by technology and by formalization of library networks.

2311,"A Man-Machine Approach Toward Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem The traveling salesman problem belongs to an important class of scheduling and routing problems.  It is also a subproblem in solving others, such as the warehouse distribution problem. It has been attacked by many mathematical methods with but meager success. Only for special forms of the problem or for problems with a moderate number of points can it be solved exactly, even if very large amounts of computer time are used. Heuristic procedures have been proposed and tested with only slightly better results. This paper describes a computer aided heuristic technique which uses only a modest amount of computer time in real-time to solve large (100-200) point problems. This technique takes advantage of both the computer's and the human's problem-solving abilities. The computer is not asked to solve the problem in a brute force way as in many of today's heuristics, but it is asked to organize the data for the human so that the human can solve the problem easily.  The technique used in this paper seems to point to new directions in the field of man-machine interaction and in the field of artificial intelligence. ",cacm

The limited resources or libraries, particularly in the developing countries, do not permit them to increase library space or budget at a rate commensurate with this rise in publication.. Consequently research libraries in such countries as India must be highly selective in their acquisition programmes and to do so without detriment to the research interests of the institution they serve, they urgently need dependable data on the ranking of periodicals according to the particular research needs of their respective countries.. In this article an attempt is made to rank periodicals in the field of the biomedical sciences, from the point of view of the Indian scientist..

1813,"A Computer Analysis Method For Thermal Diffusion in Biochemical Systems In the thermal detection of rapid biochemical reactions it is necessary to correct the temperature data for transient heat conduction losses in a cylindrical calorimeter. To handle the complexities arising from varying thermal-relaxation times of concentric insulating layers, a computer program was developed which gives the temperature distribution of the system as a function of radius and time. This distribution is corrected at each step by a subroutine which calculates the instantaneous chemical state of there action, as well as the heat produced by this reaction.  The program is based on a direct statement of Fourier's law of heat conduction and the chemical rate equation to provide a ""bookkeeping law"" to follow the reactants and the flow of heat packets, in such a way that the computer continually stores the heat distribution. A computer analysis method is here regarded as one in which the physical laws of a process are used explicitly in the program. Usually this results in by passing much of the mathematical procedures conventionally used. The program was tested against some known exact solutions of the heat equation and gave identical results, and compared well with experimental data of a known biochemical reaction.  The construction of computer programs based on the direct statement of the physical laws is a principle of general applicability which has been applied to several other physical phenomena. ",cacm

A hypothetical methodology is presented for measuring this utility by means of an elicitation procedure.. Because the hypothetical methodology is impractical, compromise methods are outlined and their underlying simplifying assumptions are discussed.. The more plausible the simplifying assumptions on which a performance measure is based, the better the measure.. This, along with evidence gleaned from 'validation experiments' of a certain kind, is suggested as a criterion for selecting or deriving the best measure of effectiveness to use under given test conditions..

3632,"Analysis and Organization of Knowledge for Retrieval  In a university, the mode of research is usually what is called 'pure' or 'basic' research; since I am keeping in mind primarily the applications of information science, I will prefer the word 'basic', although there is not so much difference. In such research, and really in any good research, one should not be collecting data haphazardly. One must isolate and define a problem and, as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors are eliminated. Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable proportions. It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of hypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtaining evidence for or against that hypothesis. The important task is to devise just that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible. If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence upon which to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, one is ready for a further step forward, and so on. Research is easier in a fully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or human situation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this does not alter the general methodology. On the whole, I find a clear methodology lacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today. ",cisi

And, concurrently, there were concerns being quietly expressed that some of the shortages could be ameliorated by a changed utilization of existing manpower.

The widespread use of complex third generation computing systems has led to a much broader concern about the means by which the resources of these systems are allocated among the user community. One means that is suggested more and more frequently is a pricing procedure. In this paper the manner in which one would like to allocate computing resources is considered, and then the extent to which a pricing mechanism fits this mold is discussed. Inasmuch as pricing must serve as a rationing mechanism at times, consideration is given to the means by which prices can be adjusted flexibly in order to make a dynamic allocation of resources. Consideration is also given to the means by which users can be insulated from the harmful effects of frequent price fluctuations. Although the subject of pricing has been given a lot of attention recently, a number of misconceptions persist about its purpose and its operation. An attempt is made to clarify some of these misunderstandings and to highlight the advantages and disadvantages and to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of pricing.

The object of the work is to clarify how the word description can be made precise so that computer algorithms for feature extraction may be obtained; the focus is on the theoretical subject matter. The results consist of a set-theoretic definition of width-at-angle, a theorem relating it to the pattern boundary radius vector, and descriptions of alternate widths. All widths are calculated for an illustrative example; graphical and tabular comparisons are given. Substantial variation in width-at-angle magnitude is found. The principal conclusion is that the set-theoretic width-at-angle is a useful pattern feature when it can be easily computed. Further investigation of the information contained in only part of a width function is recommended for cases where computation of width-at-angle is difficult. ",cacm

205,"A Model for Type Checking Most current programming languages treat computation over different classes of objects (e.g. numbers, strings, labels and functions). For correct compilation and execution, the following question then arises: is a program properly constructed so that its operations and operands are compatible? The activity of answering this question is usually called type checking. This paper attempts to isolate the notion of type checking and presents a partial solution to the type checking problem based on the notions of abstraction and application of functions. In particular, a program is mapped into an expression within a decidable subset of the Lambda calculus, which characterizes the type relations within the program and eliminates all other information. The determination of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding Lambda calculus expression to one of two normal forms, the constant ""correct"" for a type-wise correct program or the constant ""error"". An application to type checking in Algol 60 is made, and the attendant problems faced for any notion of type checking are discussed. ",cacm

These models show that adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary conditions for an optimal routing, Adaptive routing tends to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate routes because it does not consider the impact of its current routing decision on the future state of the network. The form of the optimality conditions suggests that a modification of the adaptive algorithm will result in optimality. The modification requires the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead of a linear one in the routing table maintained at each network node. Simulation results are presented which confirm the theoretical analysis for a simple network. ",cacm

The system is intended to monitor a large scale experiment in file organization for a real-time, interactive chemical information system. It is based upon a topological screen system that ensures the inclusion of every compound atom (including H) in at least one screen assignment, that appears to be responsive to a broad range of query types, and that is amenable to random- access techniques. The Monitor system is also considered, in this paper, as an independent interim approach toward fulfilling, in an effective and economic manner, the functional requirements of a small- to medium-sized chemical information system. Thus it could be used to encode and generate structure files, to assign search screens, and to provide manual substructure search capability via microfilm or hard copy printed indexes. ",cisi

(1964) have also isolated from parathyroid extracts a protein that is inert in vivo but stimulates mitochondrial transport of phosphate in vitro. they postulated that this protein might be yet another biologically important factor produced by para- thyroid glands. the latter speculation may not be warranted in view of the uncertain specificity of protein effects on mitochondria. all of our tests completed to date show that the non-hormonal parathyroid proteins c1 and c2 are unrelated either biologically, immunologically, or chemically (by amino-acid analysis) to the parathyroid hormone. further rigorous studies are necessary to precisely determine whether any effects of parathyroid hormone on mitochondria validly reflect the mechanism of action of the hormone and whether it is sound to use the in vitro tests as bioassay tools.

1581,"Cold-Start vs. Warm-Start Miss Ratios In a two-level computer storage hierarchy, miss ratio measurements are often made from a ""cold start,"" that is made with the first-level store initially empty. For large capacities the effect on the measured miss ratio of the misses incurred while filling the first-level store can be significant, even for long reference strings. Use of ""warm-start"" rather than ""cold-start"" miss ratios cast doubt on the widespread belief that the observed ""S-shape"" of lifetime (reciprocal of miss ratio) versus capacity curve indicates a property of behavior of programs that maintain a constant number of pages in main storage.  On the other hand, if cold-start miss ratios are measured as a function of capacity and measurement length, then they are useful in studying systems in which operation of a program is periodically interrupted by task switches. It is shown how to obtain, under simple assumptions, the cache miss ratio for multiprogramming from cold-start miss ratio values and how to obtain approximate cold-start miss ratios from warm-start miss ratios.

By including transformations within calls to these procedures it is possible both to simplify the specification of pictures and to speed up their generation. Display procedures permit picture elements to be defined conditionally and also facilitate the processing of inputs from pointing devices.

6447,"functional craniology: an aid in interpreting roentgenograms of the skull analysis of the form of the skull is facilitated by considering it to be composed of a number of functional components. for the roentgenologist's purposes, division into the facial or somatic skeleton and the neu- ral skeleton is valuable, as is the recognition of three functionally separate portions within each calvarial bone: the inner table, the diploe and the outer table. the base of the skull is the only por- tion that is preformed in cartilage. this ac- counts for the unusual appearance of the skull in achondroplasia. in addition, the base apparently is more closely related to facial and general somatic growth than to neural growth. calvarial bone forms directly from membrane within the cerebral capsule. consequently, the size and shape of the cal- varia directly reflect the form of the grow- ing neural mass. the inner table of the calvaria at all ages is intimately related to the dura mater and directly reflects the form of the dura mater. consequently, the inner table re- flects the form of the arachnoid mater and, usually, of the brain as well. the outer table of the calvaria serves not only to protect the brain but also to anchor many of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the skull. its form, particularly in thick-skulled mammals such as the pig, is determined more by the demands of these muscles and of the scalp than by the form of the brain. the principal function of the diploe is to form a lightweight yet rigid separation of the two osseous tables. in addition, it serves as a site of hematopoiesis; for this reason it may tend to a specific volume at a given age. the calvarial sutures oppose separa- tion of the bones of the calvaria while al- lowing relative motion between them. when the calvarial bones are passively car- ried apart with the expanding cerebral cap- sule by the growth of the neural mass, their areas are increased by the deposition of bone in the suture margins. the sutures, however, do not function as epiphyses and have no innate growth potential: removal of a suture does not disturb final skull form. because the calvaria represents ossi- fication of the cerebral capsule, it is small when the neural mass is small. the de- formity of the skull and the secondary changes that occur in the air sinuses and the diploe can be explained in terms of the functional cranial components. the op- posite changes occur when the neural mass is abnormally large. the correlation between skull size and intelligence is only fair. the presence of a brain of distinctly abnormal size, however, may be inferred from plain roentgeno- grams of the skull. premature closure of the cranial su- tures may be due to an abnormal form of the cranial base and possibly of the primi- tive chondrocranium that precedes it. the abnormality is mediated through the dural fiber tracts that underlie the major cal- varial sutures.

3640,"Factors in the Transfer of Technology  The strong correlation between the scope and depth of this country's research and development activities and the vigor and the growth of its industrial plant is today a widely accepted fact. Government expenditures for research and development have increased from a modest annual rate of $200 million some thirty years ago to $17 billion today. The research budgets of the private sector of the economy, which were almost miniscule in the 1930's, total approximately $8 billion today. These expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results, ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics, but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional product represented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledge whose application, for the most part, is still a potential one. The sophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products in which we engage today, which require vast research expenditures to find the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or the most accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces an increase in the national level of scientific and technological competence that has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy. The value of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application can be estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate of billions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increased technical capability. As a national resource for underwriting further economic and industrial development, this technical inventory is a factor of major importance. ",cisi

The technique to be illustrated puts these advantages to use in that it enables one to program directly from a decision table. The technique is based on the creation of a binary image of a limited entry decision table in computer memory.  A binary image of a given set of input conditions can also be created. This data image is used to scan the decision table image to arrive at the proper course of action. There are several advantages gained from the programming point view: (1) amount of computer memory used is drastically reduced, (2) programming is simplified, and (3) documentation is brief and clear.

The system compares this password with one recorded in a Password Table which is available to only the authentication program. The integrity of the system depends on keeping the table secret. In this paper a password scheme is presented which does not require secrecy in the computer.  All aspects of the system, including all relevant code and data bases, may be known by anyone attempting to intrude. The scheme is based on using a function H which the would-be intruder is unable to invert. This function is applied to the user's password and the result compared to a table entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of the user. The intruder may know all about H and have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system only if he can invert H to determine an input that produces a given output. This paper discusses issues surrounding selection of a suitable H. Two different plausible arguments are given that penetration would be exceedingly difficult, and it is then argued that more rigorous results are unlikely.

1204,"Significant Event Simulation This paper compares a new method of simulation organization, called the significant event method, with an old one, called the clock pulse method, using as examples two automobile traffic models. The significant event method is found to be more efficient than the clock pulse method at low levels of system interaction and less efficient at high levels. A simple mathematical model for the trade-off in the relative running time of the two methods is developed. The model aids in choosing between the two simulation methods for a particular experiment. It is concluded that the significant event method can be of value in the simulation of some systems when computational efficiency is of sufficient importance. ",cacm

441,"Improved Event-Scanning Mechanisms for Discrete Event Simulation Simulation models of large, complex ""real-world"" applications have occasionally earned the reputation of eating up hours of computer time. This problem may be attributed in part to difficulties such as slow stochastic convergence.

This paper presents a method for significantly reducing the time spent scanning future event lists in discrete event simulations.  There models are presented, all of which improve in effectiveness as the events-list scan problem becomes more burdensome. ",cacm

A suitable measure of retrieval performance is then the Recall ratio - the fraction of the relevant references that are retrieved by the system.. When the file is large this method of measuring performance is not practicable, and Recall cannot be measured although it can be estimated.. A number of estimation procedures are examined and found unsatisfactory..

1602,"Experiments in Automatic Learning for a Multipurpose Heuristic Program An automatic learning capability has been developed and implemented for use with the MULTIPLE (MULTIpurpose Program that LEarns) heuristic tree-searching program, which is presently being applied to resolution theorem-proving in predicate calculus. MULTIPLE's proving program (PP) uses two evaluation functions to guide its search for a proof of whether or not a particular goal is achievable. Thirteen general features of predicate calculus clauses were created for use in the automatic learning of better evaluation functions for PP. A multiple regression program was used to produce optimal coefficients for linear polynomial functions in terms of the features.  Also, automatic data-handling routines were written for passing data between the learning program and the proving program, and for analyzing and summarizing results. Data was generally collected for learning (regression analysis) from the experience of PP. A number of experiments were performed to test the effectiveness and generality of the learning program. Results showed that the learning produced dramatic improvements in the solutions to problems which were in the same domain as those used for collection learning data. Learning was also shown to generalize successfully to domains other than those used for data collection. Another experiment demonstrated that the learning program could simultaneously improve performance on problems in a specific domain and on problems in a variety of domains. Some variations of the learning program were also tested. ",cacm

4592,"A Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge  On almost all the occasions when we turn explicitly to the same problems, Sir Karl's view of science and my own are very nearly identical. We are both concerned with the dynamic process by which scientific knowledge is acquired rather than with the logical structure of the products of scientific research. Given that concern, both of us emphasize, as legitimate  data the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life, and both of us turn often to history to find them. From this pool of shared data, we draw many of the same conclusions. Both of us reject the view that science progresses by accretion; both emphasize instead the revolutionary process by which an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one; and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the older theory's occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic, experiment, or observation. Finally, Sir Karl and I are united in opposition to a number of classical positivism's most characteristic theses. We both emphasize, for example, the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observation with scientific theory; we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts to produce any neutral observation language; and we both insist that scientists may properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena and that do so in terms of real objects, whatever the latter phrase may mean.

The CALBPC project was begun in 1965 by nine academic libraries in Colorado in an effort to establish a centralized acquisition and processing center. The report of Phase I-II, completed in June 1968, dealt primarily with a general feasibility study, the design of the central system, costs of acquiring and processing in nine libraries and a number of related concerns such as accounting, the congruence of approval plans and user attitudes toward library services.   This report focuses on the experimental operations which were concluded officially on September 30, 1969. Whereas the Phase I-II study dealt with the theory and principles upon which a system might be based, we are presently concerned with the pragmatics of book processing, the obstacles encountered, and the solutions achieved.   Although this report deals primarily with cooperative acquisitions and processing, we believe it also contributes to a better understanding of cooperative programs. The experiment was designed to monitor operations throughout the acquisition/ cataloging cycle. Performance and cost measurements were made on most internal and external aspects of the system. Monitoring also extended into the participating libraries where a product acceptance study was conducted. A secondary objective of the project was to observe the relationships which formed between the participants and the central agency, such as the interface of systems and the human interaction of participants and the Center.

406,"Formal Parsing Systems Automatic syntactic analysis has recently become important for both natural language data processing and syntax-directed compilers. A formal parsing system G = (V,u,T,R) consists of two finite disjoint vocabularies, V and T, a many-many map, u, from V onto T, and a recursive set R of strings in T called syntactic sentence classes. Every program for automatic syntactic analysis determines a formal parsing system. A directed production analyzer (I,T,X,p) is a nondeterministic pushdown-store machine with internal vocabulary I, input vocabulary T, and all productions of p in the form: (Z,a) -> aY1 ... Ym where Z, Yi are elements of the set I and a is an element of the set T. Every context-free language can be analyzed by a directed production analyzer. The Kuno-Oettinger multiple-path syntactic analyzer for English is a concrete example of a directed production analyzer and of a working parsing algorithm. The connection between structures assigned by the analyzer and those of a conventional phrase structure grammar is examined in this paper. ",cacm

The previous format for listing atoms and bonds has been modified so that each ring system is now separately identified, and this ring-system identifier is used in the record for each substance that contains that ring. These modifications support CAS nomenclature derivation and also a computer-based structure output system. The general design of Registry III, which involves a structure record of cyclic and acyclic segments, is presented. ",cisi

One such network has been constructed in the San Francisco Bay Area by Stanford University. This paper reports upon the lessons learned from the operation of the network over the past two years. A major impact of the network was not so much the computer power delivered to the schools as the awakening of computing awareness and the fostering of capability development at these schools. The expertise and assistance from the central facility as well as the sharing of ideas among the participants were other important benefits. Both the quality and variety of services provided by the central facility were found to play a key role in the effectiveness of the network.

Algorithm Algorithms for computing the resultant of two polynomials in several variables, a key repetitive step of computation in solving systems of polynomial equations by elimination, are studied. Determining the best algorithm for computer implementation depends upon the extent to which extraneous factors are introduced, the extent of propagation of errors caused by truncation of real coefficients, memory requirements, and computing speed. Preliminary considerations narrow the choice of the best algorithm to Bezout's determinant and Collins' reduced polynomial remainder sequence (p.r.s.) algorithm. Detailed tests performed on sample problems conclusively show that Bezout's determinant is superior in all respects except for univariate polynomials, in which case Collins' reduced p.r.s. algorithm is somewhat faster. In particular Bezout's determinant proves to be strikingly superior in numerical accuracy, displaying excellent stability with regard to round-off errors. Results of tests are reported in detail.

The MARC records provided a search data base for an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with biweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified fields of interest..   Of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in participating, 209 (70 percent) responded affirmatively.. Only 40 participants could be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number of faculty members in each department or school: anthropology-l, business-10, economics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3..   An ""interest"" statement from each faculty member was translated into both Library of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject heading terms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash, parenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OF becomes six terms: U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF).. The resulting ""interest profiles"" were recorded on punched cards for computer matching with subject headings and class numbers..   The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARC records.. Each profile was assigned a ""cutoff weight"" or ""hit level"" of 6.. Subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the sum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less than the hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a particular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a hit would occur on any matching number..   Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists.. Program Extract used MARC Master Tapes as input and extracted the card number (accession number), subject heading terms, and class number for current records; Program Retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those in the profiles and recorded the card numbers for ""hits""; Program Print compared these card numbers with those on complete MARC records and printed three copies of each record to be sent to the faculty.. One copy was for the faculty member's own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be used for making recommendations to the library..   Subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the MARC file mainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record, whereas there is only one class number; and a hit often occurred on a record's second or third heading..   The SDI system performed well in selecting performed well in selecting relevant records, and overall evaluations were highly favorable.. Some 73 percent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to the faculty. The majority felt that the SDI service provided an automatic, regular notification of new works.. They felt that it usually brought works to their attention quicker than other sources; it informed them of items they otherwise would have missed; it furnished a compact source listing books in all but only their fields; it required very little time; and it provided a convenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased the amount of recommending done..

Transfers between the core and drum stores and to and from the twin paper-tape input and output channels are all available autonomously (concurrently, time-shared).  Multiplication and division orders are also autonomous, so that the machine may be executing up to three orders simultaneously. All functions naturally are interlocked.  A number of other advanced orders and facilities are also incorporated.In particular, an ""Execute"" order permits a temporary jump for up to four orders and a second modifier register permits double modification in general and relative addressing of subroutines in particular. Thus the overall effective speed of the machine is muchhigher than its basic specification would lead one to expect and its design indicates one way in which the concepts of time sharing may be incorporated in ""low-cost"" computers.

2921,"Proving Termination with Multiset Orderings A common tool for proving the termination of programs is the well-founded set, a set ordered in such a way as to admit no infinite descending sequences. The basic approach is to find a termination function that maps the values of the program variables into some well-founded set, such that the value of the termination function is repeatedly reduced throughout the computation. All too often, the termination functions required are difficult to find and are of a complexity out of proportion to the program under consideration. Multisets (bags) over a given well-founded set S are sets that admit multiple occurrences of elements taken from S. The given ordering on S induces an ordering on the finite multisets over S. This multiset ordering is shown to be well-founded. The multiset ordering enables the use of relatively simple and intuitive termination functions in otherwise difficult termination proofs. In particular, the multiset ordering is used to prove the termination of production systems, programs defined in terms of sets of rewriting rules. ",cacm

3752,"SDI: Some Economic and Organizational Aspects  In the context of the present symposium it would seem appropriate that I should deal specifically with the economic aspects of Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) operation and use. In my opinion the technical feasibility and merits of SDI have been adequately demonstrated; the main barriers hindering general use, however, tend to be of an economic nature.  At Shell Research in Sittingbourne we have been operating, since 1967, an SDI service for the research staff and it has grown rapidly, particularly since we started to use the CA Condensates tapes early in 1969. In addition to these tapes we are currently using the BA Previews tapes, AGDOC tapes (prepared by ourselves using punched card input received from Derwent) and, on an experimental basis, Toxitapes, produced by BIOSIS, Philadelphia. All these tapes are searched locally, involving the running of around five hundred profiles weekly. ",cisi
2856,"Experiments with the M & N Tree-Searching Program The M & N procedure is an improvement to the mini-max backing-up procedure widely used in computer program for game-playing and other purposes. It is based on the principle that it is desirable to have many options when making decisions in the face of uncertainty. The mini-max procedure assigns to a MAX (MIN) node the value of the highest (lowest) valued successor to that node. The M & N procedure assigns to a MAX (MIN) node some function of the M (N) highest (lowest) valued successors. An M & N procedure was written in LISP to play the game of kalah, and it was demonstrated that the M & N procedure is significantly superior to the mini-max procedure. The statistical significance of important conclusions is given. Since information on statistical significance has often been lacking in papers on computer experiments in the artificial intelligence field, these experiments can perhaps serve as a model for future work.

The second of these chapters, ""Contributions to the Theory of Reference Group Behavior,"" draws upon the ample evidence provided by The American Soldier to formulate certain conditions under which people orient themselves to the norms of various groups, in particular the groups with which they are not affiliated.  The other two chapters added to this edition have not been published before.

3654,"Mathematical Approach to the Spread of Scientific Ideas - The History of Mast Cell Research  One of the most intriguing problems of modern science is the obscure nature of its own growth. Indeed, there are few notable scientists who have not, at one time or another, given serious thought to the questions of how their particular science has reached its present state and what will be the course of its future development. These questions seem to be of such importance to scientists that they have emerged as fundamental scientific problems in their own right.  Goffman and Newill have pointed out that the process by which ideas spread within a population of scientists possesses epidemiological properties and can therefore be investigated as an epidemic process. Consequently, a new set of mathematical tools can be applied to the problem of explaining the nature of scientific development. In particular, this approach makes it possible to establish the relative importance of past lines of inquiry within a given area of scientific research, and to predict the future behavior of existing lines of investigation as well as the emergence of important new ones within the given area.  The purpose of this communication is to demonstrate this method by applying it to the development of knowledge about mast cells. In his recent comprehensive survey of this subject, Prof. Hens Selye has assembled a ""full bibliography"" in which ""every aspect of the mast cell is dealt with.""

6225,"on early infantile psychosis. the symbiotic and autistic syndromes in conclusion, i wish to state that the core of child psychosis must be sought in one or the other of the described distortions of the sym- biotic phase. in the first case, what lay at the heart of the psychotic dis- turbance was the marked emotional unavailability of the mother, which alternated with a purely physical extreme closeness during the breast-feeding situations, and particularly with the destructiveness of the mother's unpredictable rage attacks. the contrasting experiences drove the child to the autistic warding off of any human contact and the de-animation of the world of reality. constitutional factors could not, in this case, be evaluated with any degree of accuracy. in the second case, it was, by contrast, the mother's ever-presence that created an unendurable instrusion upon and interference with the structuralization of the budding ego, which constitutionally and perhaps predispositionally may have been very vulnerable. this made it impossible for the infant to experience the normal alternation of the gratification-frustration sequences at his own pace; it also made the process of individuation in the separation-individuation period one which was beset with abysmal panic. in both instances, we can see that it was primarily in the severe dis- tortions of the normal symbiosis that the child psychosis had its roots.

83,"A Simple Algorithm for Computing the Generalized Inverse of a Matrix The generalized inverse of a matrix is important in analysis because it provides an extension of the concept of an inverse which applies to all matrices.  It also has many applications in numerical analysis, but it is not widely used because the existing algorithms are fairly complicated and require considerable storage space. A simple extension has been found to the conventional orthogonalization method for inverting non-singular matrices, which gives the generalized inverse with little extra effort and with no additional storage requirements. The algorithm gives the generalized inverse for any m by n matrix A, including the special case when m+n and A is non-singular and the case when m>n and rank(A) = n. In the first case the algorithm gives the ordinary inverse of A. In the second case the algorithm yields the ordinary least squares transformation matrix INV(A'A)A' and has the advantage of avoiding the loss of significance which results in forming the product A'A explicitly.

1855,"The Eschenbach Drum Scheme The prime function of a drum, operating in real time, is to perform accesses quickly. The usual means for increasing this capacity is to incorporate engineering or hardware improvements. In this paper the problem is attacked not by changing the drum, but rather by modifying the manner in which it operates. At the outset, a drum is given a functional definition. Then a simple design scheme (Eschenbach) is introduced which enormously increases the rate of accessing for drums so defined. This is shown to enable a system to perform a job by employing fewer or less expensive drums. It is suggested that although the design scheme has a specific use, the method underlying it has more general applicability. The question of the efficacy of the drum scheme is then raised. To deal with this, a standard of efficiency is developed in light of realistic real-time circumstances. The drum scheme is then modelled in a manner which permits it to be analyzed as a problem in queueing theory. Thus one is enabled to ascertain whether the drum scheme is efficient enough for its application. Again, whereas the analysis of the drum scheme has a specific use, the methods underlying it have more general applicability. ",cacm

Of the major institutions in American society, science has received perhaps the least systematic attention. Little is known about how scientists achieve positions of renown. This book examines several aspects of a single basic question: is the stratification of individuals in science based upon the quality of scientific performance, or does discrimination obtain in the processes of status attainment?

A split tree is a binary search tree each node of which contains two key values-a node value which is a maximally frequent key in that subtree, and a split value which partitions the remaining keys (with respect to their lexical ordering) between the left and right subtrees. A median split tree (MST) uses the lexical median of a node's descendents as its split value to force the search tree to be perfectly balanced, achieving both a space efficient representation of the tree and high search speed. Unlike frequency ordered binary search trees, the cost of a successful search of an MST is log n bounded and very stable around minimal values. Further, an MST can be built for a given key ordering and set of frequencies in time n log n, as opposed to n2 for an optimum binary search tree.

5466,"stability of compressible boundary layers induced by a moving wave . stability of compressible boundary layers induced by a moving wave .  the problem of determining the stability of compressible viscous flows with nonzero surface velocities is formulated and is shown to be identical to that for conventional boundary layers, with only a redefinition of the mach and reynolds numbers required . specific consideration is given to the wall boundary layer behind a moving shock wave, and the minimum critical reynolds numbers are obtained for various shock velocities . the entire stability map is determined for the limiting case of a weak wave, which is analogous to the rayleigh problem .  the minimum critical reynolds number is found to increase monotonically with shock velocity--i.e., with increasing surface cooling and stream mach number combined . for the ratio of wall to stream velocity of 2.92 with (shock mach number of 2.18) the flow is found to be infinitely stable to two-dimensional disturbances .  experimental transition data do not follow the trends predicted by the theory . in fact, the transition reynolds numbers are orders of magnitude below the computed minimum critical reynolds numbers . the lack of correlation between theory and experiment is attributed to disturbances which are external to the boundary layer .

3413,"The Effect of a Large-Scale Photocopying Service on Journal Sales   The proposition is examined that large-scale photocopying, such as that practised by the British Library Lending Division, affects the sales of journals.. There is little evidence of a reduction in journal circulation figures.. In spite of large increases in journal prices (which have risen much faster, in terms of cost per page, than the Retail Price Index), university libraries have, since the NLLST was established, devoted an increasingly high proportion of their budgets to journals, though recent financial pressures are now forcing cancellation.. An extensive survey of demand for journals at BLLD shows a heavy concentration on a relatively small number of titles, most of them well established journals, widely held by libraries and with large circulations.. The demand for in-print issues of the average journal is small.. It is concluded, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that economic difficulties experienced by journals publishers and the increased demand on the BLLD are unrelated, though both owe something to the economic pressures on libraries..

3402,"Cooperation Between Types of Libraries  This bibliography uses the traditional typology of libraries as its starting point - public, school, academic-research, and special libraries. This classification is most commonly used and provides a sufficiently clear distinction for the purposes of this work.  Public libraries are those which are free to all residents of the library's district and supported primarily from general public funds or taxes levied for library purposes. Local public libraries, systems of public libraries, and state library agencies are included in this category.  School libraries are those maintained by the governing boards of schools whether they be public, private, or parochial. School libraries at the elementary, junior high school, and senior high school level are included.  Academic-research libraries include the libraries of institutions of higher education, both public and private, as well as libraries which, while they might be defined as either public or special, are widely known for their research resources. Junior college libraries, college libraries, university libraries, and technical school libraries are included as academic libraries. The Library of Congress, the Newberry Library, and Linda Hall Library are examples of nonacademic research libraries.  Special libraries are those directed toward making information available to people within a particular organization with fairly well-defined information needs. Business and industrial libraries and the libraries of nonprofit organizations are common examples.  While distinctions between research and special libraries are not always easily made, it is felt that in the case of this bibliography, no serious problems are created. ",cisi

772,"Time-Sharing and Batch-Processing: An Experimental Comparison of Their Values in a Problem - Solving Situation An experimental comparison of problem-solving using time-sharing and batch-processing computer systems conducted at MIT is described in this paper.  This study is the first known attempt to evaluate two such systems for what may well be the predominant user population within the next decade-the professionals who, as nonprogrammers, are using the computer as an aid in decision-making and problem-solving rather than as a programming end in itself. Statistically and logically significant results indicate equal cost for usage of the two computer systems; however, a much higher level of performance is attained by time-sharing users. There are indications that significantly lower costs would have resulted if the time-sharing users had stopped work when they reached a performance level equal to that of the batch users. The users' speed of problem-solving and their attitudes made time-sharing the more favorable system. ",cacm

This was published in the Journal of Documentation in September 1965 and in his paper he looks at a limited number of British use studies and draws some broad general conclusions relating to the development of a national information service. The present paper which covers the literature back to the beginning of 1966 is somewhat more detailed. It considers a wide range of investigations into the information gathering habits of scientists, engineers, social scientists and others, and reports results which it is hoped will provide managers with information on which to develop policies regarding library and information services at all levels. Although an increasing number of studies is being carried out in Eastern Europe and in the USSR there has been no major work reported and consequently the review considers mainly British and American investigations.

The shading algorithm itself depends in part on the method for modeling the object, which also determines the hidden surface algorithm. The various methods of object modeling, shading, and hidden surface removal are thus strongly interconnected.  Several shading techniques corresponding to different methods of object modeling and the related hidden surface algorithms are presented here. Human visual perception and the fundamental laws of optics are considered in the development of a shading rule that provides better quality and increased realism in generated images. ",cacm
1429,"A Scan Conversion Algorithm with Reduced Storage Requirements Most graphics systems using a raster scan output device (CRT or hardcopy) maintain a display file in the XY or random scan format. Scan converters, hardware or software, must be provided to translate the picture description from the XY format to the raster format. Published scan conversion algorithms which are fast will reserve a buffer area large enough to accommodate the entire screen. On the other hand, those which use a small buffer area are slow because they require multiple passes through the XY display file. The scan conversion algorithm described here uses a linked list data structure to process the lines of the drawing in strips corresponding to groups of scan lines. A relatively small primary memory buffer area is used to accumulate the binary image for a group of scan lines. When this portion of the drawing has been plotted, the buffer is reused for the next portion. Because of the list processing procedures used, only a single pass through the XY display file is required when generating the binary image and only a slight increase in execution time over the fully buffered core results. Results slow that storage requirements can be reduced by more than 80 percent while causing less than a 10 percent increase in execution time. ",cacm

A program sequence P for M' is termed M-admissible (relative to a specific execution time period) if there is a mapping underwhich P and its effective data referents are all located in the direct address set of M. Storage allocation is considered as a process of establishing for an arbitrary M' program a sequence of mappings, a decoupling of the program into M-admissible subprograms and a linking set of interludes.

3975,"Professional Standing and the Reception of Scientific Discoveries  The Matthew Effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognition for a particular scientific contribution depending on their location in the stratification system. Merton originally introduced the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of multiple discoveries or collaborators. In this paper the concept is generalized to apply to all scientific work. If the Matthew Effect were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system. To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of similar design. In each study we control for the number of citations papers received at time 2. This enables us to look at groups of papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2. We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's location in the stratification system. All the data indicate that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important determinant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratification variables. However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery. The Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious points of the social system of science. All other stratification variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards did not influence the speed of diffusion. Data are presented that indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low- ranking scientists. The Matthew Effect also serves to focus attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame. A discussion is included of the relevance of these data for the study of resistance to scientific discoveries. ",cisi

H. Friend, where F is the number of memory cells used. The expected length of the j-th sequence is determined to be F times a j-th degree polynomial in e, such that the value of this polynomial approaches 2 as j approaches infinity. Recursive formulas are obtained for both the mean and the standard deviation of the length of the j-th sequence.  The mathematical proofs of these results are based upon the assumption that n, the number of items to be sorted, is infinite, but it is shown that the error due to the finiteness of n approaches zero rapidly as n increases.

6779,"relationships of growth hormone, steroids and relaxin in the transformation of pubic joint cartilage to ligament in hypophysectomized mice the histological changes occurring in the pubic joint of hormonally treated intact or hypophysectomized mice have been studied. estrogen treatment resulted in bone resorption and transformation of the cartilage caps of the pubic bones to fibrocartilage in intact mice but not in hypophysectomized mice. furthermore, relaxin failed to influence the appearance of the pubic joint of estrogen-primed hypophysectomized mice, whereas it induced the development of long interpubic ligaments in intact mice. when growth hormone (sth) was administered to hypophysectomized mice, the pubic joints responded to estrogen with bone resorption and transformation of the cartilage caps to fibrocartilage. sth treatment also restored the ability of the pubic joint of hypophysectomized mice to proliferate long interpubic ligaments when estrogen and relaxin were administered. progesterone specifically inhibited ligament formation due to relaxin injection without altering the histological changes associated with estrogen treatment, both in intact mice and in sth-maintained, hypophysectomized mice.

5737,"scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds and methods for fixing transition in model experiments . scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds and methods for fixing transition in model experiments .  the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds arise from differences between the conditions under which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate, and in how they behave after separation . for turbulent boundary layers, these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatly as the reynolds number is changed and in many examples, it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulent layers that occur naturally at high reynolds number and for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixed artificially . the scale effects arising in wind-tunnel tests made at low reynolds number may, therefore, often be minimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow by introducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced by excrescences attached to the surface . the fact that the effects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers than for the turbulent layers that are likely to be encountered at full scale, makes it all the more important to do this whenever possible .  several methods which can be used to fix transition are described, and the results obtained by using them are compared . in general, in experiments in two-dimensional flow, good agreement is found, and explanations can be advanced for cases in which discrepancies occur . several uncertainties and difficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussed and illustrated by examples . in particular, special care is needed in interpreting the results obtained with transition fixed at very low reynolds numbers (say, less than about r = 1 x 10 based on local chord for wings of about 0.1 thickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinner wings) .  the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increased for three-dimensional wings, particularly if they are swept-back or highly tapered (i.e., small chord and reynolds number near the tip) and if the tests cover a large range of incidence including high incidences for which the flow may separate from very close to the leading edge . under these circumstances, it is frequently necessary to place the excrescences at different chordwise positions for low and high angles of incidence, and this is inconvenient in practice . more research is needed before sound recommendations can be made as to how and where transition should be fixed on such models, particularly since in routine testing, it is often not possible to check the effects of transition-fixing fully .  in the sections dealing with three-dimensional tests, examples are given of the spurious results that have been avoided successfully by fixing transition, of the conditions where even at low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transition may not be necessary to give a turbulent boundary layer ahead of the shock, and of the conditions under which there are some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transition have been satisfactory .

4341,"Effectiveness of Combining Title Words and Index Terms in Machine Retrieval Searches  Our experiment was based on volume 24 of Nuclear Science Abstracts (NSA) which contains about 53,000 citations; we used the generalized file-management system, Master Control, which can operate in either an inverted or a linear search mode. The inverted mode uses a table composed of the unique vocabulary contained in one or more data elements, along with all record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs. For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs. For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each word was found. (In Master Control, a word is defined as any set of characters bounded on either side by a legal separator such as a blank, period, comma, colon, etc.) On the other hand, in a linear search mode the data element is compared with the profile word, character by character, which results in a prohibitively time-consuming process for large data bases.  We chose the inverted-table technique because of the large amount of data to be searched. Individual tables were constructed from the titles of the articles, NSA index terms, and titles and index terms combined. NSA index terms are controlled by the Euratom Thesaurus, as revised for NSA.  We used two criteria in the study. First, the questions had to be of real interest to laboratory personnel. Some of the questions had actually been submitted by other members of the staff, to be run concurrently on the same data base on an SDI basis. The others were especially constructed by the authors for this experiment. Second, citations obtained were to be considered good (or relevant) only if they actually pertained to the subject in question; otherwise, they were to be considered ""false drops,"" regardless of the number of words matched between the profile and the citation.

The analysis does not assume uniformly distributed branching ratios, and therefore is applicable to a family of sorting algorithms discussed by Hoare, Singleton, and van Emden.  The solution to the integral equation indicates that using more advanced algorithms in the family makes only minor reductions in the expected sorting effort, but substantially reduces the variance in sorting effort. Statistical tests of the values of several thousand trees containing up to 10,000 points have given first, second, and third moments of the value distribution function in satisfactory agreement with the moments computed from the generating function.

6630,"3083. myocardial toxicity of contrast agents used in angiography the myocardial toxicity of many current and some experimental contrast agents has been studied in dogs, by use of a previously unreported method of occlusion retrograde coronary venography as well as the familiar technique of selective coronary arterial catheterization. the following conclusions appear justified in the light of the experiments  not only the iodine-containing radicals with which the contrast agents are so often identified (acetrizoates, diatrizoates, iothalamates, etc.), but also the final salification products appear to be responsible for the widely divergent degrees of myocardial toxicity of contrast agents, to the point that differ- ent salts of the same compound behave as entirely different agents both chemically and biologically. the results seem to indicate the dominance of sodium ion and/or the protective effect of methylglucamine salts with respect to the myocardial toxi- city of current radiopaque media. reported, yet unexplained, electrocardiographic changes occurring within one to two seconds from the beginning of massive caval high-pressure injections appear to find a causal relationship in the myocardial ir- ritability induced by the distention of the coronary veins and the myocardial infiltra- tion which is intentionally enhanced with our retrograde injection techniques. a pe- culiar trait, shared in varying degrees by all radiopaque agents tested, is their ability to increase coronary blood flow. the clinical significance of this phenome- non, however, remains to be established. these studies re-emphasize the limita- tions of the standard toxicity studies conducted in animals. it should be clear from the results reported that agents to be administered into the coronary circulation demand investigation in regard to their potential toxicity by the methods described herein or variations thereof. in fact, similar tests should be carried out for all or- gans to be subjected to radiographic examination via the vascular bed. the authors hope that this presentation will stimulate renewed investigation, particularly in view of the growing clinical applications of selective cardiovascular opacification tech- niques.

(1) the expansion-controlled trail, which treats the behavior of the wake behind the body up to a point, along the direction of flight, where the pressure decays to the free-stream value and cooling is controlled principally by the expansion of the flow, and (2) the conduction-controlled trail, where the trail cools mainly by diffusion of heat away from the high-temperature core .  the influence of the details of the body shape on the observables are discussed and a simple computational procedure for the behavior of the conduction-controlled trail is developed based on integral methods . results of calculations that assume thermodynamic equilibrium of the flow field give the values of the thermodynamic variables in the trail of a sphere, axial distributions of emitted thermal radiation, and maps of electron density distribution . it is shown that the cooling of the conduction-controlled trail is essentially due to conduction of heat and that viscous effects are not important . it is found that this portion of the trail does not widen as one proceeds downstream . flight velocities considered vary between 15,000 and 35,000 ft sec and altitudes range between 100,000 and 250,000 ft .

Through the use of segmentation, however, Multics provides direct hardware addressing by user and system programs of all information, independent of its physical storage location. Information is stored in segments each of which is potentially sharable and carries its own independent attributes of size and access privilege. Here, the design and implementation considerations of segmentation and sharing in Multics are first discussed under the assumption that all information resides in large, segmented main memory.

2698,"Some Basic Determinants of Computer Programming Productivity The propose of this research was to examine the relationship between processing characteristics of programs and experience characteristics of programmers and program development time. The ultimate objective was to develop a technique for predicting the amount of time necessary to create a computer program. The fifteen program characteristics hypothesized as being associated with an increase in programming time required are objectively measurable from preprogramming specifications. The five programmer characteristics are experience-related and are also measurable before a programming task is begun. Nine program characteristics emerged as major influences on program development time, each associated with increased program development time. All five programmer characteristics were found to be related to reduced program development time.  A multiple regression equation which contained one programmer characteristic and four program characteristics gave evidence of good predictive power for forecasting program development time.  ",cacm

The access time of this storage is similar to the cycle time of the machine (50-100 nsec). This microstorage is used to contain both data and subroutines. The (micro) instructions in such a processor differ from the conventional in that they perform only purely combinatorial operations; sequencing is under the control of the microinstruction. The presence of the read-write microstorage permits a more flexible assignment of resources than the read-only storage. In particular, the processor developed in this paper stresses the simultaneous operation (within the microinstruction) of the adder, shifter, masker, and testing facilities of the processor.  A microassembly language is developed and the overhead involved in subroutine linkages is analyzed.  The efficiency of a flexible software linkage scheme is examined as to its overhead for various subroutine characteristics.

626,"Fen-An Axiomatic Basis for Program Semantics A formal system is presented which abstracts the notions of data item, function, and relation.  It is argued that the system is more suitable than set theory (or its derivatives) for the concise and accurate description of program semantics. It is shown how the system can be used to build composite data types out of simper ones with the operations of rowing, structuring, and uniting. It is also demonstrated that completely new primitive types can be introduced into languages through the mechanism of singleton data types. Both deterministic and nondeterministic functions are shown to be definable in the system.  It is described how the local environment can be modeled as a data item and how imperative statements can be considered functions on the environment. The nature of recursive functions is briefly discussed, and a technique is presented by which they can be introduced into the system. The technique is contrasted with the use of the paradoxical combinator, Y. The questions of local and global environments and of various modes of function calling and parameter passing are touched upon. The theory is applied to the proof of several elementary theorems concerning the semantics of the assignment, conditional, and iterative statements. An appendix is included which presents in detail the formal system governing webs and fen, the abstractions used informally in the body of the paper. ",cacm

Viewed in this way, and perhaps as antidote to the more rigidly formalistic treatments of the technical matters of research, the editors' concern here has been less with the rituals and far more with the fundamental nature of intellectual inquiry and its societal contribution, with the modes of analysis, the habits of thought and expression which characterize scholarship and the scholar.  Another primary purpose has been to put research into a context which clearly depicts the task of the researcher, and so illuminates realistically not only the rigor and the discipline, but the human triumphs and joys which derive from its accomplishment. Seen thus, as a dynamic field fit for the adventurer of the mind, perhaps it may succeed in enticing more to its fold from among those in librarianship with imaginative and creative capacity, who have not before held this perspective of research.

In scientific psychology, this occurred in the late nineteenth century in Germany.. Using Germany as a positive case, and France, Britain and the United States as negative cases, it is shown that the new role resulted from academic career opportunities favoring the mobility of practitioners and students of psychology into other fields, and from the relatively low academic standing of speculative philosophy and its consequent receptivity to persons and ideas which promised to turn the study of the human mind into an experimental science..

The interest in effective undergraduate education which led to the creation of these libraries, however, is not of such recent origin. As early as 1608, when Thomas James was appointed to Bodley's Library, ""he proposed the establishment of an undergraduate library to help the younger student. But Sir Thomas Bodley was opposed."" So it is to Harvard that we turn for an example of the protracted concern for the undergraduate's plight.   Despite the concern voiced by these earlier writers, most universities and their libraries were relatively small until this century. More important, they were largely undergraduate institutions. The great expansion of graduate education is a twentieth-century phenomenon. The problems of the undergraduate in using university collections were greatly compounded by the striking growth in the size of collections and by an increasing emphasis on the acquisition of materials suitable for research.   The large university collections became increasingly difficult for the undergraduate to use. When he had to select his books from the card catalog and obtain them through paging in a closed-stack system, he might well abandon the attempt before finally locating a book which was not checked out, missing, or at the bindery - and which was suitable for his purposes. The university library was also difficult to use because it was crowded - study conditions were unsatisfactory and staff was insufficient to handle the volume of work. ",cisi

1263,"WATFOR-The University of Waterloo FORTRAN IV Compiler WATFOR is an in-core, load-and-go compiler which has been implemented within the IBM 7040/44 operating system. FORTRAN IV was selected as the source language in order to achieve maximum language compatibility with other available compiling systems, in particular the IBM 7040/44 FORTRAN IV system.  The principal advantage of the WATFOR compiler is that it translates FORTRAN IV programs at speeds of up to 100 statements per second. Since the compiler resides core there is virtually no system overhead, and hence large batches of ""student"" programs may be processed very efficiently. The compiler also provides extensive error diagnostics, during both the compilation and the execution phases of a program run.  This feature makes the system attractive to both learners and learned users alike. ",cacm

7034,"antidiuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazide in diabetes insipidus and ch'iuan-lu 12 cases of diabetes insipidus were studied during hydrochlorothia- zide therapy under a fixed diet. the symptoms, blood pressure, urinary volume, blood and urinary electrolytes, plasma volume, electrocardiogram and hypertonic saline intravenous drip test were compared before and after treat- ment. a daily dose of 100-150 mg brought down the urinary volume to about 50% of the pretreatment value. the initial antidiuretic effect was noted 8 hours after medication and the maximal effect after the fourth or fifth day. owing to the kaluretic action of the drug, 2-4 gm of potassium salt was also given each day. satisfactory re- sults were obtained with dietary sodium ion at not more than 200 meq daily, but ingestion of excessive table salt fre- quently diminished or even destroyed the therapeutic effect. the physical signs, blood pres- sure and ecg were essentially un- changed and the plasma volumes were altered after treatment. the hyper- tonic saline test was improved in some of the patients. low salt syndrome was fre- quently encountered as the therapy continued over 1 month. but this and even secondary failure could be pre- vented by timely use of intermittent or alternative regimen. the therapeutic mechanism, indications and side effects of the drug were briefly discussed. the drug might possibly act through the mechanism of salt depletion, contraction of extracel- lular fluid volume and decrease of renal glomerular filtrate, and in consequence urinary volume decreases and thirst is alleviated.

The ordinary way of doing this would be either to talk popular science or to adopt one of the various styles in humanistic discussion of the reactions between men and science. Previous lecturers in this series have given accounts of the content of space science and made excursions into the philosophy and the history of science. Although professionally my concern is with the history of science, I have a certain prehistoric past as a physicist, and this has led me to treat these lectures in what is, perhaps, an extraordinary way.  My goal is not discussion of the content of science or even a humanistic analysis of its relations. Rather, I want to clarify these more usual approaches by treating separately all the scientific analyses that may be made of science. Why should we not turn the tools of science on science itself? Why not measure and generalize, make hypotheses, and derive conclusions? ",cisi

Classical implementations of list processing systems lack this property because allocating a list cell from the heap may cause a garbage collection, which process requires time proportional to the heap size to finish. A real-time list processing system is presented which continuously reclaims garbage, including directed cycles, while linearizing and compacting the accessible cells into contiguous locations to avoid fragmenting the free storage pool. The program is small and requires no time-sharing interrupts, making it suitable for microcode. Finally, the system requires the same average time, and not more than twice the space, of a classical implementation, and those space requirements can be reduced to approximately classical proportions by compact list representation.

It is a computational aid for the casual user, which provides basic facilities for graphical and numeric input and display, online and off line program preparation and storage, and hard copy presentation of results. Use of the system requires a minimum of experience or instruction, since the growth of an overlaying system control language has been prevented, and there are no processor-oriented statements, like variable type or dimension declarations. Moreover, in the online situation the processor interacts with the graphical keyboard on a character-by-character basis so as to restrict the programmer's choice of input symbols to those which are syntactically correct. DIALOG has been in daily operation at the IIT Research Institute since February, 1966. ",cacm

This primary memory requirement estimate was employed in an experimental version of Multics to control the level of multiprogramming in the system and to bill for memory usage.

3510,"Is a Scientific Revolution Taking Place in Psychology? - Doubts and Reservations  We were introduced by Kuhn to the notion of scientific progress as a series of qualitative changes, each involving the overthrow of a prevailing paradigm of thought by a new paradigm which alters the whole perspective of a science. Palermo has appropriately summarized Kuhn's analysis. It seems, if we judge by constant citations of Kuhn and the references to paradigms, crises and revolutions among scientists and philosophers, that he has induced a novel self-consciousness about the growth of scientific knowledge and the nature of cumulativeness in the expansion of understanding - and not least among psychologists. This may be in small part (though I doubt it) because one of psychology's concerns is the empirical study of the growth of knowledge: Jean Piaget, whose influence in some quarters has now become so great that he is hailed as a revolutionary in those quarters, has for several decades been developing a theory of the growth of knowledge - or, if you insist, of the development of cognition - which, like Kuhn's account (in his preface Kuhn acknowledges illumination from Piaget), eschews accumulation and posits a sequence of qualitative changes each of which completely reorganizes thinking.

As an example of this, it is the boast of Pomona College that over seventy per cent of her graduates have taken subsequent professional training.

The criticism usually relates to the recognition that librarianship is more of a service and less of a fact- finding field of endeavor and that librarians are primarily trained to assist in the research activities of others rather than to conduct their own. One can add here that the average librarian who spends about forty hours a week on his job not always has the stamina to spend his free time on original research or the writing of proposals, which either are not adequately funded or are not published with the prominence hoped for. If the librarian-researcher commits his findings to writing, he is occasionally criticized for writing poorly or for having dwelled on topics of limited interest to the reviewer.

698,"Database Abstractions: Aggregation Aggregation is in troduced as an abstraction which is important in conceptualizing the real world. Aggregation transforms a relationship between objects into a higher-level object. A new data type, called aggregation, is developed which, under certain criteria of ""well-definedness,"" specifies aggregation abstractions. Relational databases defined as collections of aggregates are structured as a hierarchy on n-ary relations. To main tain well-definedness, update operations on such databases must preserve two invariants. Well-defined relations are distinct from relations in third normal form. It is shown that these notions are complementary and both are important in database design. A top-down methodology for database design is described which separates decisions concerning aggregate structure from decisions concerning key identification. It is suggested that aggregate types, and other types which support real-world abstractions without in troducing implementation detail, should be incorporated into programming languages. ",cacm

Inter-institutional cooperation not only promises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new problems and demands. Formalized cooperation among different institutions requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user subgroups. It also requires more careful and productive system planning and design, including intelligent consideration of the ""make versus buy"" issue. Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and considerations.  One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth in the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated by the federal government and those operated by the private sector. The apparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same problems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed materials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less rapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs, serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes. The inclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series - reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the ownership and distribution of information. Another aspect of that controversy - the role of government and non-profit information services in relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year's chapter on document retrieval systems and techniques.

The emphasis of the study as stated by COSATI is as follows:   1. Initial and primary priority will be placed on national systems relating to scientific and technical documents, their handling and the management of such documents. Specific matters to be reported on will include, the current organizational and functional situation in the United States; the extent to which known deficiencies are causing a reduction in the potential for technical effectiveness in the United States scientific and technical community; the alternatives which are available and economically feasible for correction of these deficiencies; and one or more action plans which can be followed by governmental (especially including Congress) and non-governmental units.   2.

The technique permits computation of numerical values of derivatives without developing analytical expressions for the derivatives. The key to the method is the decomposition of the given function, by introduction of intermediate variables, into a series of elementary functional steps. A library of elementary function subroutines is provided for the automatic evaluation and differentiation of these new variables. The final step in this process produces the desired function's derivative.  The main feature of this approach is its simplicity.  It can be used as a quick-reaction tool where the derivation of analytical derivatives is laborious and also as a debugging tool for programs which contain derivatives. ",cacm

On the other hand, if both k and the subject grammar are problem parameters, then the complexity of the problem depends very strongly on the representation chosen for k. More specifically, it is shown that this problem is NP-complete when k is expressed in unary. When k is expressed in binary the problem is complete for nondeterministic exponential time.

A reference count scheme for reclaiming non-self-referential structures, and a linearizing, compacting, copying scheme to reorganize all storage at the users discretion are proposed. The algorithms are designed to work well in systems which use multiple levels of storage, and large virtual address space. They depend on the fact that most cells are referenced exactly once, and that reference counts need only be accurate when storage is about to be reclaimed. A transaction file stores changes to reference counts, and a multiple reference table stores the count for items which are referenced more than once. ",cacm

This approach, the intermittent-assertion method, involves documenting the program with assertions that must be true at some time when control passes through the corresponding point, but that need not be true every time. The method, introduced by Burstall, promises to provide a valuable complement to the more conventional methods. The intermittent-assertion method is presented with a number of examples of correctness and termination proofs. Some of these proofs are markedly simpler than their conventional counterparts.  On the other hand, it is shown that a proof of correctness or termination by any of the conventional techniques can be rephrased directly as a proof using intermittent assertions. Finally, it is shown how the intermittent-assertion method can be applied to prove the validity of program transformations and the correctness of continuously operating programs. ",cacm

655,"Variable Length Tree Structures Having Minimum Average Search Time Sussenguth suggests in a paper (1963) that a file should be organized as a doubly-chained tree structure if it is necessary both to search and to update frequently. Such a structure provides a compromise between the fast search/slow update characteristics of binary searching and the slow search/fast update characteristics of serial searching. His method, however, contains the limiting restriction that all terminal nodes lie on the same level of the tree. This paper considers the effect of relaxing this restriction.  First, trees which have the property that a priori the filial set of each node is well defined are studied.  It is proved that coding the nodes within each filial set with respect to the number of terminal nodes reachable from each is necessary and sufficient to guarantee minimum average search time. Then the more general case (that is, where the entire structure of the tree is changeable) is treated. A procedure is developed for constructing a tree with a minimum average search time. A simple closed expression for this minimum average search time is obtained as a function of the number of terminal nodes. The storage capacity required to implement the doubly-chained tree structure on a digital computer is also determined. Finally, the total cost of the structure, using Sussenguth's cost criterion, is computed.

Large scale linear programming codes at most installations are assumed to be generating correct solutions without ever having been ""bench-marked"" by test problems with known solutions. The reason for this failure to adequately test the codes is that rarely are there large problems with known solutions readily available.

It is too much to expect a research worker to spend an inordinate amount of time searching for the bibliographic descendants of antecedent papers. It would not be excessive to demand that the thorough scholar check all papers that have cited or criticized such papers, if they could be located quickly. The citation index makes this check practicable.  Even if there were no other use for a citation index than that of minimizing the citation of poor data, the index would be well worth the effort required to compile it.  This paper considers the possible utility of a citation index that offers a new approach to subject control of the literature of science. By virtue of its different construction, it tends to bring together material that would never be collated by the usual subject indexing. It is best described as an association-of-ideas index, and it gives the reader as much leeway as he requires. Suggestiveness through association-of-ideas is offered by conventional subject indexes but only within the limits of a particular subject heading. ",cisi

Taking under consideration the study of ""Bibliographical Data in National Bibliography Entries"" prepared by Michael Gorman, the experts of the Copenhagen meeting set up a working group, with Jack Wells as chairman, charged with drafting an international standard bibliographic description for monographic publications. There was common agreement that the objective was the development of specifications for the necessary data elements, their order of presentation, and the punctuation to delimit them. These specifications should be designed to satisfy the needs of national bibliographies, and, with whatever judicious trimming might be desirable, the needs of the libraries of the entire world. It was further agreed that these bibliographic descriptions were to be made quite independently of the heading under which they might appear in listings. The working group succeeded in its task and brought forth its provisional ISBD(M) in 1971; the first standard edition was published earlier this year. The success of this standard is manifested by the continuing increase in the number of countries that have adopted it. ",cisi

Furthermore, the predominant organization by type of library hampers the analysis of crosscurrents between libraries and life and thought, particularly the development of the image of the library and librarian.

3679,"Linguistics and Information Science  This paper defines the relationship between linguistics and information science in terms of a common interest in natural language. The notion of automated processing of natural language - i.e., machine simulation of the language processing activities of a human - provides novel possibilities for interaction between linguists, who have a theoretical interest in such activities, and information scientists, who have more practical goals, e.g. simulating the language processing activities of an indexer with a machine.  The concept of a natural language information system is introduced as a framework for reviewing automated language processing effort by computational linguists and information scientists. In terms of this framework, the former have concentrated on automating the operations of the component for content analysis and representation, while the latter have emphasized the data management component. The complementary nature of these developments allows the postulation of an integrated approach to automated language processing. This approach, which is outlined in the final sections of the paper, incorporates current notions in linguistic theory and information science, as well as design features of recent computational linguistic models.

While it has long been recognised that only a proportion of the stock of academic libraries is actively used academic library buildings grow both more expensive and approach capacity fullness with remarkable speed. In certain cases some new buildings are full even before they have left the design-board stage. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion reached by R.B. Morris in 1963 that 'in terms of long range perspective, responsible judgement suggests that there is no feasible choice before libraries other than a wide and continuous programme of ""selective book retirement""'. Library stock control has not received the attention it merits from librarians whose energy, time and resources have been more than fully committed by the problems of acquisition and the provision of an ever-increasing range of services for readers. Early investigations of this issue have tended to be theoretical and Carol Seymour in her review ""Weeding the Collection"" put forward the view that ""a librarian should be able to begin his plan for weeding even if the day seems far off when weeding will be necessary... He also knows the sorts of information tools he will need to have at hand when the day does dawn on his overgrown garden"".

2600,"Requirements for Advanced Programming Systems for List Processing List processing systems should be designed to facilitate production of large programs to manipulate large complex symbolic data stores. This paper presents an overview of a number of system features which the author feels are important to improve the productivity of programmers working in such domains. A system view it taken, rather than focusing just on language features, since algorithms must be not only coded in a language form, but debugged, modified, made efficient, and run on data. Because of this general framework,the requirements specified are applicable to the design of advanced programming systems for a wide range of applications. Three aspects of programming systems are highlighted: good interactive facilities, programmable control structures, and sophisticated data communication mechanisms. Interactive features are described to facilitate program composition, entry, testing, debugging, editing, optimization, and packaging. Implementation of a generalized environment structure model specified would allow programming of various control regimes including multiprocesses, coroutines and backtracking. Alternative methods of procedure invocation required include invocation by pattern and by monitoring condition. The need for extended data forms, storage management, and extensibility are stressed, as is the duality of data retrieval and function evaluation. Syntax directed input and output of data would facilitate use of complex data stores. ",cacm

An efficient method for accomplishing this reorganization is given. This also makes possible the derivation of an asymptotically better bound for multiplication of matrices given in row-oriented form by adapting the technique of Strassen to the reorganized data. The reorganization/block multiplication scheme is shown to be advantageous for matrices and pages of realistic size; the Strassen adaptation is not. The former scheme is also shown to be advantageous even if the transpose of one of the matrices is available at no additional cost. ",cacm

1926,"A Note on Linear Programming Algorithm Design: A Combinatorial Problem As linear programming models grow bigger and bigger in size, much actual data that must be memorized is often put on magnetic tape or disk, and consequently there is an improportionality fast rise in the consumption of computer time.To cut down this expense, an ever increasing effort is made to design more efficient algorithms. This paper is meant to support the effort. It is attempted to find some characteristics of the way a pivot column is found. The number of repetitions of a certain transfer of data from tape to core memory is considered.  After some simplification, the problem is restated in a general way. The generating function of the probability distribution and the moment generating function of the number of repetitions is found. Asymptotic formulas are given for the moments using a result from a paper of S. Narumi [1]. The results may be applied to write very efficient routines that search for an extreme value in a table. Formulas provide a means of calculating the computer timings in this case. ",cacm
3641,"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax  The idea that a language is based on a system of rules determining the interpretation of its infinitely many sentences is by no means novel. Well over a century ago, it was expressed with reasonable clarity by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous but rarely studied introduction to general linguistics (Humboldt, 1836). His view that a language ""makes infinite use of finite means"" and that its grammar must describe the processes that make this possible is, furthermore, a outgrowth of a persistent concern, within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind, with this ""creative"" aspect of language use (for discussion, see Chomsky, 1964, forthcoming). What is more, it seems that even Panini's grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a ""generative grammar,"" in essentially the contemporary sense of this term.  This monograph is an exploratory study of various problems that have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar, which is presupposed throughout as a general framework for the discussion. What is at issue here is precisely how this theory should be formulated. This study deals, then, with questions that are at the border of research in transformational grammar. For some, definite answers will be proposed; but more often the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possible approaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions. ",cisi

Because of feedback through recognition and resources, highly productive scientists maintain or increase their productivity, while scientists who produce very little produce even less later on.. A major implication of accumulative advantage is that the distribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort of scientists ages.. Cross-sectional survey data support this hypothesis for chemists, physicists, and mathematicians, who show strong linear increases in inequality with increasing career age.. This increase is highly associated with a changing distribution of time spent on research.. Another implication of accumulative advantage is also corroborated: the association among productivity, resources and esteem increases as career age increases.. ",cisi

The traditional methods find a hyperplane which separates all points in the other, but such a hyperplane is not necessarily centered in the empty space between the two classes. Since a central hyperplane does not favor one class or the other, it should have a lower error rate in classifying new points and is therefore better than a noncentral hyperplane. Six algorithms for finding central hyperplanes are tested on three data sets. Although frequently used practice, the modified relaxation algorithm is very poor. Three algorithms which are defined in the paper are found to be quite good. ",cacm

958,"A Software Design and Evaluation System A critical failure of current software system design and implementation methodology is that the performance of a proposed design is not evaluated before it is actually implemented. In this paper the reasons for this failure are explored, and a new methodology which overcomes many of the difficulties is proposed. A system which integrates performance evaluation with design and implementation is described.  This system is based on a simple, high level language which is used to describe the evolving system at all stages of its development. The source language description is used as direct input to performance analysis and simulation routines. Using the performance information obtained from these routines as feedback, the problems which adversely affect performance are detected early enough so that they can be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system.

One might reasonably expect that librarians, who have done so much public wailing about the publication explosion, would be among the chief advocates and practitioners of birth control in the world of print. Instead we find them cavorting as uninhibitedly in the king-size bed of printed procreation as do the denizens of the Sodom and Gomorrah of science and technology. Just about every library of any consequence (and some of little consequence) and, almost without exception, every group or organization within the loose boundaries of our profession, decides, virtually at the moment of its birth, that it cannot survive without a publication of its own - a newsletter, a journal, some regular calling card to announce its presence to the world at large.

The following variants are discussed: (1) the standard analysis of variance; (2) analyses omitting certain levels of one or more factors; (3) separate analyses for some levels of a factor or for combinations of levels of more than one factor. These are performed simultaneously; (4) the calculation of main effect or interaction means. The mean expects the data in standard order and it leaves the data in that order so that many analyses of the same data can be performed without rearrangement. The total sum of squares, excluding a replication sum of squares, is partitioned into all polynomial partitions and their interactions each with one degree of freedom. This is so even if factors have unequally spaced factor levels. ",cacm

It was in this spirit that my friend Bradford joined those men, whose noble faces have passed and to whom it never was given to see the achievement of the work to which they devoted their lives.  And it was in this spirit that Bradford, thanks to his knowledge and experience as scientist as well as librarian, not only gave his strong and valuable support to the common work but added to it fundamental and constructive new elements.  Just for this reason the present book we owe to him gives far more than a mere compilation of facts and experiences.

4659,"A Method for Allocating R & D Expenditures   The analytical problems of developing quantitative techniques for R & D investment management are often complicated by the existence of conflicting goals.. Corporate goals may require the R & D manager to simultaneously seek the highest probable profits, the largest probable number of successes, and the greatest probable profit per dollar spent.. Departmental goals may restrict the manager to some maximum budget, a minimum number of projects to be worked on, and minimum levels of accomplishment on specific projects.. In a sense, then, the research manager is faced with a constrained multiple-output production problem: how much to spend on which project and how much to spend overall.. This paper shows how a slight modification of Hess' approach to project selection and an analogy to the theoretical economics of a multiple-product factory have been used to help our research management simultaneously solve these project selection, resource allocation, and budget determination problems.. Most approaches in the literature have treated these three problems separately.. ",cisi

Further, the term is more generally applied to the practitioner rather than to the researcher. But within the rather broad definition specified, the computing practitioner is, as yet, not regarded as a professional. Each of the four types of institutions-academic, industry, government, and the professional society- that educate, employ, regulate, and mold the practitioner contributes to the ""nonprofessional"" status of the computing practitioner.

The publicity that has attended this project has, in a way, been unfortunate, for it has presented an exaggerated picture of the system and its accomplishments which has only made the sceptics more skeptical; and it has obscured in part the examination of MEDLARS' real accomplishments. There has to date been very little careful outside analysis and evaluation of MEDLARS.

The first method, the ""quotient reduction"" method, is shown to be complete in the sense that for every set I the smallest table in which the elements of I can be stored and from which they can be retrieved by using a perfect hashing function constructed by this method can be found. However, for nonuniformly distributed sets, this method can give rather sparse tables.  The second method, the ""remainder reduction"" method, is not complete in the above sense, but it seems to give minimal (or almost minimal) tables for every kind of set. The two techniques are applicable directly to small sets. Some methods to extend these results to larger sets are also presented.

3085,"An Empirical Study of List Structure in Lisp Static measurements of the list structure of five large Lisp programs are reported and analyzed in this paper. These measurements reveal substantial regularity, or predictability, among poin ters to atoms and especially among poin ters to lists. Pointers to atoms are found to obey, roughly, Zipf's law, which governs word frequencies in natural languages; poin ters to lists usually poin t to a location physically nearby in memory. The use of such regularities in the space-efficient representation of list structure is discussed. Linearization of lists, whereby successive cdrs (or cars) are placed in consecutive memory locations whenever possible, greatly strengthens the observed regularity of list structure. It is shown that under some reasonable assumptions, the entropy or information content of a car-cdr pair in the programs measured is about 10 to 15 bits before linearization, and about 7 to 12 bits after.

4272,"Program Design for Retrospective Searches on Large Data Bases   Retrospective search of large document data bases requires development of special techniques for automatic compression of data and minimization of the number of input-output operations to the computer accessible files.. Also, the computer program should be designed to require a relatively small amount of internal memory..   The present paper contains a description of the structure of a program that meets the above requirements.. The vocabulary of the data base is automatically expressed in terms of 8, 16 and 24 bit codes chosen to point to the natural spelling in a dictionary.. Thus file size is reduced without the necessity for extensive processing for decoding.. Use of a compressed bit string inverted index greatly reduces search time, and a storage management system enables long strings to be processed with use of a limited amount of internal storage.. Creation of ""reduced"" files and tables is an important feature of a program; it allows the files needed only by specific phases of the program to be designed to use a relatively small amount of internal storage and input-output time..

These changes coincided with the publication of the results of the Cranfield project, which showed clearly that all indexing languages are basically the same. However, although it was possible to teach these new approaches, there was no one textbook which covered the subject approach in the way that I felt was needed. The first edition was intended to fill this gap, and its reception, both in Britain and abroad, showed that it did indeed fulfill a real need. It met with a very positive welcome from lecturers and - more importantly - from students, particularly in the United States, where British textbooks on classification had previously been regarded with something akin to suspicion.

The average asymptotic number of comparisons needed is shown  to be an log^2(n). A formula is derived expressing a in terms of the probability distribution of the ""bound"" of a partition. This  formula assumes a particularly simple form for a generalization already considered by Hoare, namely, choice of the bound as median of a random sample. The main contribution of this paper is another generalization of quicksort, which uses a bounding interval instead of a single element as bound. This generalization turns out to be easy to implement in a computer program. A numerical approximation shows that a = 1.140 for this version of quicksort compared with 1.386 for the original. This implies a decrease in number of comparisons of 18 percent; actual tests showed about 15 percent saving in computing time. ",cacm

3088,"A Final Solution to the Dangling Else of ALGOL 60 and Related Languages The dangling else problem consists of a class of potential ambiguities in ALGOL-like conditional statements whose basic form is ""if B1 then if B2 then S1 else S2"" where B1 and B2 are Boolean expressions and S1 and S2 are basic statements. The difficulty lies in whether to attach the else to the first if or to the second one. Existing solutions to the problem are either ambiguous or unnecessarily restrictive.  Let Sand S1 be statements. We define S to be closed if ""S else S1"" is not a statement, and to be open if ""S else S1"" is a statement. Thus an unconditional statement is a closed statement. Open and closed conditional statements are defined by syntax equations in such a way as to preserve openness and closure.  In each case, an else must always be preceded by a closed statement. It is shown that the syntax equations are unambiguous, and that may change in the statement types required within the syntax equations would lead to either ambiguity or unnecessary restriction.

1483,"A Cost Oriented Algorithm for Data Set Allocation in Storage Hierarchies Data set allocation in today's multilevel storage systems is usually based on qualitative, ad hoc decisions. While it would be desirable to obtain an optimal solution to this allocation problem, it is clear that the number of parameters involved makes it intractable to straight-forward solution.  In such a situation, we must find a set of assumptions which simplify the problem greatly, but which still provide a basis for considering all significant cost elements. This paper presents such a first, quantitative allocation step. It considers many of the significant detailed costs of system utilization, data storage, data staging, and data migration. Although many avenues of further improvement are available, the present algorithm seems to be usefully accurate. As such, it can aid in quantifying the problems of data set allocation, storage system configuration, and new device designs. ",cacm

778,"Signature Simulation and Certain Cryptographic Codes Three cyphers allegedly authored by Thomas Jefferson Beale in 1822 have been the subject of intensive study for over 100 years. Generations of cryptanalysts have expended untold man-years, thus far without success, attempting tode code them; vast armies of fortune hunters and treasure seekers have devoted Herculean labors to digging up the rolling hills of Virginia trying to locate the promised bonanza.  The history of pertinent activities would fill volumes, yet serious students of cryptography have always had nagging doubts about the cyphers' authenticity.  It has been alleged that the ""known solution"" to Cypher Number Two: 115, 73, 24, 818, 37, 52, 49,...(""I have deposited in the County of Bedford about four miles from Buford's in an excavation or vault..."") with the aid of an unsanitized version of the Declaration of Independence was merely a superb, imaginative, and grandiose hoax perpetrated ages ago for whatever reasons. Modern computer technology could obviously perform signature analyses the process of encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeper insights into their construction. For the benefit of the uninitiated, the encoding method used in the second cypher employs a specified document whose words are simply numbered consecutively, and first letters of these words are sought out at random to match the letters of these words are sought out at random to match the letters of the clear text or message.  The sequence of numbers corresponding to these matches is then written down as the final code. While primitive, the process has the advantage of relative security until the source document becomes known; at that moment the cypher can be decoded even by second graders. The work now completed with the help of our UNIVAC 1108 includes numerous analytical studies of the Beale cyphers and various types of simulations.  For example, we have turned the entire process of simulated encoding by various schemes over to the machine and analyzed the signatures of these synthetic codes; we have also encoded various messages by hand, using different texts and a variety of methods to obtain their signatures. These simulations provide convincing evidence that the signatures are both process and data dependent; they indicate also very strongly that Mr. Beale's cyphers are for real and that it is merely a matter of time before someone finds the correct source document and locates the right vault in the common-wealth of Virginia.

905,"The Structure of Programming Languages The following are identified as major components of every programming language: (1) the elementary program statement, (2) mechanisms for linking elementary statements together, (3) the means by which a program can obtain data inputs. Several alternative forms of each of these components are described, compared and evaluated. Many examples, frequently from list processing languages, illustrate the forms described. Elementary program statements usually take the form of commands, requirements, or implicit specifications. A command is an imperative statement that commands the action to be taken. A requirement describes the effect to be achieved without saying anything about the actions to be taken. An implicit specification is similar to a requirement, but the programmer must understand what actions will be taken to achieve the desired effect. Subroutines may be entered explicitly, by execute call, or by function composition. Explicitly called subroutines generally require special linkage conventions. An execute subroutine call is syntactically indistinguishable from a basic instruction of the programming language.  Function composition is a convenient alternative to the explicit call. The three principal ways of getting inputs for routines are (1) by referring to the data itself, (2) by referring to the data by a ""name"", and (3) by referring to it implicitly by means of variables or functions. Names are useful entry points into permanent data structures, but can be error-causing distractions in other contexts. The author discusses advantages, disadvantages, and factors influencing the choice of a form of component for a language.  He concludes by suggesting the evolution of programming languages toward one which will permit all the most convenient ways of structuring programs, organizing systems, and referencing data. ",cacm

It used to be believed that the results of scientific investigation would lead to continuous progressive improvements in conditions of life; but first the War and then the economic crisis have shown that science can be used as easily for destructive and wasteful purpose, and voices have been raised demanding the cessation of scientific research as the only means of preserving a tolerable civilization. Scientists themselves, faced with these criticisms, have been forced to consider, effectively for the first time, how the work they are doing is connected with the social and economic developments which are occurring around them. This book is an attempt to analyze this connection; to investigate how far scientists, individually and collectively, are responsible for this state of affairs, and to suggest what possible steps could be taken which would lead to a fruitful and not to a destructive utilization of science.

The size of the dictionary is 5,542 descriptors and 3,073 keywords..   The indexing procedure includes: analysis of document content and its characterization by keywords elicited from natural text; and creation of the search pattern using the descriptor dictionary.. The techniques are described which are applied to analyze the documents into semantic aspects that constitute the elements of the formalized model of a document's condensed content.. The procedure employed to translate a text into the retrieval language comprises selection of words both from the title and the body of the document..   Main principles for retrieval efficiency determination using mathematical-statistic methods are given..   Tests on multi-subject collections show a probability of 85-% recall and 70-% relevance at a standard deviation of 25%.. These findings have been corroborated by the results of the basic experiment on a file of up to 2,500 search patterns using 42 requests.. Among the factors of losses there are the poor quality of abstracts (into cards) and the absence of a single abstracting procedure; it is proposed that abstractors should be in future charged with writing abstracts in keywords and, ultimately, in the descriptor language.. The experimental results attest to the feasibility and practical sensibility of creating a multi-disciplinary information retrieval system to be  based on a broad-scope descriptor dictionary and on the suggested methods for document and request indexing..

A solution is offered in the form of a computer program which allows the user to constrain and direct the generation by the simple but powerful device of restricted subtrees.

3091,"Reentrant Polygon Clipping A new family of clipping algorithms is described.  These algorithms are able to clip polygons against irregular convex plane-faced volumes in three dimensions, removing the parts of the polygon which lie outside the volume. In two dimensions the algorithms permit clipping against irregular convex windows.  Polygons to be clipped are represented as an ordered sequence of vertices without repetition of first and last, in marked contrast to representation as a collection of edges as was heretofore the common procedure. Output polygons have an identical format, with new vertices introduced in sequence to describe any newly-cut edge or edges. The algorithms easily handle the particularly difficult problem of detecting that a new vertex may be required at a corner of the clipping window. The algorithms described achieve considerable simplicity by clipping separately against each clipping plane or window boundary. Code capable of clipping the polygon against a single boundary is reentered to clip against subsequent boundaries.  Each such reentrant stage of clipping need store only two vertex values and may begin its processing as soon as the first output vertex from the proceeding stage is ready. Because the same code is reentered for clipping against subsequent boundaries, clipping against very complex window shapes is practical.  For perspective applications in three dimentions, a six-plane truncated pyramid is chosen as the clipping volume. The two additional planes parallel to the projection screen serve to limit the range of depth preserved through the projection. A perspective projection method which provides for arbitrary view angles and depth of field in spite of simple fixed clipping planes is described. This method is ideal for subsequent hidden-surface computations. ",cacm

The orientation is toward a formal definition of behavioral elements in an individual's ""purposeful state"": specifically, these elements are his objectives, his valuation of each objective, his possible courses of action, the efficiency of each course of action in achieving each objective, and his probability of choice for each course of action.  The amount of information in a purposeful state is explicitly defined in terms of the probabilities of choice of the available courses of action. The amount of information in a message is defined as the difference between the amount of information in the purposeful state following the message, and the amount of information in the purposeful state preceding the message. The amount of instruction in a purposeful state is defined in terms of the efficiencies of the available courses of action; and the amount of motivation is defined in terms of the values of the objectives.	The amounts of instruction and motivation in a message are defined, just as information is, by comparing the amounts in a purposeful state before and after receipt of the message.  The value of a purposeful state to an individual is defined as a function of the amount of information, the amount of instruction, and the amount of motivation in the state. This concept can be generalized to express the value of the state to some other individual. ",cisi

2683,"Implementing Clenshaw-Curtis Quadrature, II Computing the Cosine Transformation In a companion paper to this, ""I Methodology and Experiences,"" the automatic Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature scheme was described and how each quadrature formula used in the scheme requires a cosine transformation of the integrand values was shown. The high cost of these cosine transformations has been a serious drawback in using Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature.  Two other problems related to the cosine transformation have also been trouble some. First, the conventional computation of the cosine transformation by recurrence relation is numerically unstable, particularly at the low frequencies which have the largest effect upon the integral. Second, in case the automatic scheme should require refinement of the sampling, storage is required to save the integrand values after the cosine transformation is computed. This second part of the paper shows how the cosine transformation can be computed by a modification of the fast Fourier transform and all three problems overcome. The modification is also applicable in other circumstances requiring cosine or sine transformations, such as polynomial interpolation through the Chebyshev points. ",cacm

Production of Indicative Abstracts by Application of Contextual Inference and Syntactic Coherence Criteria   Together with the increasing shortage of qualified abstracts, the factors of time, cost and value have lent impetus to a trend toward the automatic generation of abstracts and indexes.. This trend has caused increased emphasis to be placed on the abstract as the locus of data for automatic retrieval systems.. This necessitates the creating of high quality abstracts.. It is the purpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for the automatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of the original document.. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under which various methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to develop criteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstract can be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to the abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the most significant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection and rejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentence reference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automatic abstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, called the Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functions specified for each WCL entry..

The data describe instances in which respondents acquired useful technical information from sources outside their immediate circle of colleagues.. The analysis is descriptive in character, following a functional approach in which the use of various means of information transfer is considered in relation to the purposes of technical work..   While the data, in general, confirm the results of other studies of this sort, they demonstrate also that the relative use of alternative means will vary significantly with the circumstances of their use.. The report explores the association of variations in a number of specific personal, organizational, and technological factors with variations in the use of sources of information.. In a more general interpretation of these findings, those variations are related to aspects of the goals of the work to which the information was applied..   The purposes of technical work are considered along two basic dimensions, one relating to the potential for contribution to the development of some body of systematic knowledge, the other to the support of particular operational objectives..

Formal and more distant sources are the most common means used when the focus is on ""professional"" goals, i.e., those concerned with contributions to knowledge..

A new synchronization mechanism is proposed, using abstract objects called eventcounts and sequencers, that allows processes to control the ordering of events directly, rather than using mutual exclusion to protect manipulations of shared variables that control ordering of events. Direct control of ordering seems to simplify correctness arguments and also simplifies implementation in distributed systems. The mechanism is defined formally, and then several examples of its use are given. The relationship of the mechanism to protection mechanisms in the system is explained; in particular, eventcounts are shown to be applicable to situations where confinement of information matters. An implementation of eventcount s and sequencers in a system with shared memory is described. ",cacm

3364,"Science and Information Theory  A new scientific theory has been born during the last few years, the theory of information. It immediately attracted a great deal of interest and has expanded very rapidly. This new theory was initially the result of a very practical and utilitarian discussion of certain basic problems: How is it possible to define the quantity of information contained in a message or telegram to be transmitted? How does one measure the amount of information communicated by a system of telegraphic signals? How does one compare these two qualities and discuss the efficiency for coding devices? All of these problems, and many similar ones, are of concern to the telecommunication engineer and can now be discussed quantitatively.  From these discussions there emerged a new theory of both mathematical and practical character. This theory is based on probability considerations. Once stated in a precise way, it can be used for many fundamental scientific discussions. It enables one to solve the problem of Maxwell's demon and to show a very direct connection between information and entropy. The thermodynamic entropy measures the lack of information about a certain physical system. Whenever an experiment is performed in the laboratory, it is paid for by an increase of entropy, and a generalized Carnot Principle states that the price paid in increase of entropy must always be larger than the amount of information gained. Information corresponds to negative entropy, a quantity for which the author coined the word negentropy. The generalized Carnot Principle may also be called the negentropy principle of information. This principle imposes a new limitation on physical experiments and is independent of the well-known uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics. ",cisi

4386,"Library Education and the Public Library  A major and largely justifiable criticism of library education has always been that it is too closely tied to present practices and that it trains for current service instead of educating for growth and change. Unfortunately, the picture many faculty members have of what today's requirements for public library service are tends to be obsolete. Graduates are thus doubly handicapped. Not only do we fail to educate, we fail even to provide realistic training. At worst, we perpetuate the past and train people for tasks that are no longer central to the concerns of public libraries.  Library education, like the public library itself, will have to accelerate the pace of change or risk the fate of oblivion. Institutions that can move with the times and maintain a position of relevance to contemporary affairs will survive. Others will wither away, disappear, or be replaced by more responsive agencies. There is no shortage of prophets of doom for both the public library and for graduate library education, but there are plenty of signs of life yet in both.

1753,"Analyses of Deterministic Parsing Algorithms This paper describes an approach for determining the minimum, maximum, and average times to parse sentences acceptable by a deterministic parser.  These quantities are presented in the form of symbolic formulas, called time-formulas. The variables in these formulas represent not only the length of the input string but also the time to perform elementary operations such as pushing, popping, subscripting, iterating, etc. By binding to the variables actual numerical values corresponding to a given compiler-machine configuration, one can determine the execution time for that configuration. Time-formulas are derived by examining the grammar rules and the program representing the algorithm one wishes to analyze. The approach is described by using a specific grammar that defines simple arithmetic expressions. Two deterministic parsers are analyzed: a top-down recursive descent LL(1) parser, and a bottom-up SLR(1) parser. The paper provides estimates for the relative efficiencies of the two parsers. The estimates applicable to a specific machine, the PDP-10, are presented and substantiated buy benchmarks. Finally, the paper illustrates the proposed approach by applying it to the analyses of parsers for a simple programming language.  ",cacm

Inverted-file retrieval systems using free text data bases commonly identify words as the keys or index terms about which the file is inverted, and through which access is provided.. They therefore involve large and growing dictionaries and many entail inefficient utilization of storage because of the distribution characteristics..   An alternative approach may be based on the analysis of text in terms of sets of variable-length character strings, the frequency distributions of which are much less disparate than those of words.. This could lead to substantial reductions in dictionary size, and increased efficiency both in dictionary look-up times and storage utilization. ",cisi

3165,"A General Business-Oriented Language Based on Decision Expressions* The structure of a digital compute programming language which covers a wide class of business and file processing applications is presented. Such a structure, based on identifying and incorporating into a compiler the aspects common to all processes of such class, permits writing extremely compact programs, even for comparatively complex applications, in terms of tables of control expressions which express only information characteristic of the particular application. Furthermore,local changes of a process (e.g. changes affecting only one of the output files involved) can be effected by local modifications in the program (e.g. modification of only one entry of the tables). This structure also allows for inexpensive preparation of loading-speed compilers which translate the source programs into efficient machine codes.  The approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical language design philosophies. It stresses the structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented in the languages, as opposed to emphasizing formal (i.e., contents-independent) syntactical definitions.  It relies exclusively on nonprocedural representation of process as sets (tables) of relations between data and results (there are no control statements such as GO TO, etc.), instead of using procedure descriptions (which are one-to-one translations of flowcharts). Here an invariant pattern of procedure is identified as characteristic of the class of all batch file processes. This new philosophy has the potential to overcome well-known deficiencies of other business-oriented languages and fully meets the requirements set by CODASYL for such languages, including machine-independence.

There are many potential interference problems in products made up of assemblies of components and in product manufacturing and testing. Typically, drawings are used in an attempt to detect such unwanted interferences, but the two-dimensional, static drafting medium does not always show interferences among three-dimensional, moving parts. This paper  presents a computer representation for solids and surfaces and algorithms which carry out interference checking among objects so represented.  Objects are represented as polyhedra or as piecewise planar surfaces. Two types of interference checking are discussed: detection of intersections among objects in fixed positions and detection of collisions among objects moving along specified trajectories. ",cacm

The various index languages vary widely with respect to their fidelity.. Differences in their performance are correspondingly great..   The lack of fidelity in most of the present day indexing languages is due mainly to insufficient representation of the relationships among concepts.. We describe a new graphical method of storing and retrieving concept relations of various kinds..

2716,"The Expanding World of Computers The onward sweep of automatic processing of information is impeded by nine principal barriers: geography, cost, problem complexity, man-machine communication, inadequate sensors, lack of understanding, distance, time, and size. The main incentive for breaching these barriers is the universal need for processing information, ever more urgent as the greater part of human work activity changes from production to service. Computer developments in hardware, programming, time-sharing, education, data communication, and displays are judged by how effectively they remove these barriers, and their barrier-smashing potentialities indicate continued rapid expansion. Problem-oriented languages are particularly effective over the entire front. Online computers and time-sharing also rate high by this measure. Education and increased understanding are basic to all progress with the computer. This complex but powerful tool is the most important one available to governments and scientists to use in studying the problems being created by the population explosion, and in analyzing possible solutions.

This hampers a correct choice of the sources of secondary information and leads to duplication, parallelisms and loss of information.. Judgements of the leading Soviet and foreign bibliographers relating to the problems under consideration are reviewed, which are all essentially in favor of a reconstruction of the publishing processes, issuing of scientific publications on a world scale, and algorithmization of the information processes..

3339,"Computer Handling of Chemical Structure Information  Far-reaching changes in the patterns of communication in science are at present in motion, which seem likely to have fundamental effects on scientists's use of and access to existing knowledge. These changes derive from the increasing involvement of computer techniques in the publication, dissemination and retrieval of scientific and technical information. Many of the implications of the changes are not yet clear. Information-handling is rapidly changing from a labour-intensive industry to a capital-intensive one, as soaring man-power requirements reflect the increasing flow of information and increasing demands for timeliness, accuracy, and improved access. But the changes to be effected also have major social implications; the reasons for publication and use of information are complex, reflecting the factors of a sociological nature which are still imperfectly understood. The rate at which innovations in information- handling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by their appreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer, but also by the sensitivity, on the part of the designers and operators of information systems, to the needs and habits of users, and to their perception of the usefulness of the newer methods.

A selective tree searching procedure controlled by tactical chess logistics allows a deployment of multiple minimal game calculations to achieve some optimal move selection. The tree searching algorithms are the heart of COKO's effectiveness, yet they are conceptually simple. In addition, an interesting phenomenon called a tree searching catastrophe has plagued COKO's entire development just as it troubles a human player. Standard exponential growth is curbed to a large extent by the definition and trimming of the Fischer set. A clear distinction between tree pruning and selective tree searching is also made.  Representation of the chess environment is described along with a strategical preanalysis procedure that maps the Lasker regions. Specific chess algorithms are described which could be used as a command structure by anyone desiring to do some chess program experimentation.

4216,"A Mathematical Theory of Communication  The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information.  The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. ",cisi

This would be surprising if classification were no more than a fairly convenient way of arranging books on shelves.

Yet today we can see clearly two relatively new spectacles on the library scene: on the one hand, some librarians are criticizing the Decimal Classification (especially as used in the British National Bibliography) for being too detailed and unwieldy; on the other hand, some librarians, and still more information officers, are busy revising the Universal Decimal Classification in order to make it more detailed.

Solutions have been given for the mutual exclusion problem and associated subproblems, in the form of parallel programs, and informal proofs of correctness have been given for these solutions. In this paper a system of parallel processes is regarded as a machine which proceeds from one state S (i.e. a collection of pertinent data values and process configurations) to a next state S' in accordance with a transition rule S --> S'. A set of such rules yields sequences of states, which dictate the system's behavior. The mutual exclusion problem and the associated subproblems are formulated as questions of inclusion between sets of states, or of the existence of certain sequences. A mechanical proof procedure is shown, which will either verify (prove the correctness of ) or discredit (prove the incorrectness of) an attempted solution, with respect to any of the interference properties. It is shown how to calculate transition rules from the ""partial rules"" by which the individual processes operate.  The formation of partial rules and the calculation of transition rules are both applicable to hardware processes as well as to software processes, and symmetry between processes is not required.

3166,"Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs Conventional programming languages are growing ever more enormous, but not stronger. Inherent defects at the most basic level cause them to be both fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style of programming inherited from their common ancestor-the von Neumann computer, their close coupling off semantics to state transitions, their division of programming into a world of expressions and a world of statements, their inability to effectively use powerful combining forms for building new programs from existing ones, and their lack of useful mathematical properties for reasoning about programs. An alternative functional style of programming is founded on the use of combining forms for creating programs.  Functional programs deal with structured data, are often nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require the complex machinery of procedure declarations to become generally applicable. Combining forms can use high level programs to build still higher level ones in a style not possible in conventional languages.  Associated with the functional style of programming is an algebra of programs whose variables range over programs and whose operations are combining forms.  This algebra can be used to transform programs and to solve equations whose ""unknowns"" are programs in much the same way one transforms equations in high school algebra. These transformations are given by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language in which programs are written. Combining forms are chosen not only for their programming power but also for the power of their associated algebraic laws. General theorems of of the algebra give the detailed behavior and termination conditions for large classes of programs. A new class of computing systems uses the functional programming style both in its programming language and in its state transition rules. Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems have semantics loosely coupled to states-only one state transition occurs per major computation. ",cacm

It cannot be accomplished by either profession alone; rather, the design of a library system is a team effort between librarians, computer system analysts, and programmers. Even a limited effort demands careful long-term planning if it is to fit with later efforts into a cohesive whole. The smallest project will affect nearly all operations of the library. For these reasons it is necessary that all library staff have at least a general overview of what library automation is all about. ",cisi
4563,"Career Contingencies and the Fate of Sociological Research  During the past three hundred years the journal article has become the main institutionalized form of formal scholarly communication. Potential contributions to a discipline acquire credibility because they have been published in a reputable journal (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971). Who published what and where therefore becomes a central question in the understanding of scholarly, and in particular scientific, disciplines. There have recently been a number of investigations concerning the career of such publications. This career, I suggest, can be conceptualized into three stages. 1) Pre-publication. Here the scholar writes the article, circulates it to colleagues and perhaps presents it at formal and informal meetings (Garvey, Lin and Nelson, 1971). 2) Publication. Here the article is submitted to one or more journals for publication consideration (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971). 3) Post-publication. Here colleagues either ignore the published article or reward it through citations to it in their own work. The practice of citing a colleague's work is perhaps the main way in which scholars indicate what they consider to be a contribution to their discipline. ",cisi

5528,"a new theory for the buckling of thin cylinders under axial compression and bending . a new theory for the buckling of thin cylinders under axial compression and bending .  the results of experiments on axial loading of cylindrical shells (thin enough to buckle below the elastic limit and too short to buckle as euler columns) are not in good agreement with previous theories, which have been based on the assumptions of perfect initial shape and infinitesimal deflections . experimental failure stresses range from 0.6 to 0.15 of the theoretical . the discrepancy is apparently considerably greater for brass and mild-steel specimens than for duralumin and increases with the radius- thickness ratio . there is an equally great discrepancy between observed and predicted shapes of buckling deflections .  in this paper an approximate large-deflection theory is developed, which permits initial eccentricities or deviations from cylindrical shape to be considered . true instability is, of course, impossible under such conditions,. the stress distribution is no longer uniform, and it is assumed that final failure takes place when the maximum stress reaches the yield point . the effect of initial eccentricities and of large deflections is much greater than for the case of simple struts . measurements of initial eccentricities in actual cylinders have not been made,. however, it is shown that most of these discrepancies can be explained if the initial deviations from cylindrical form are assumed to be resolved into a double harmonic series, and if certain reasonable assumptions are made as to the magnitudes of these components of the deviations . with these assumptions the failing stress is found to be a function of the yield point as well as of the modulus of elasticity and the radius-thickness ratio . on the basis of this a tentative design formula (5) is proposel, which involves relations suggested by the theory but is based on experimental data .  it is shown that similar discrepancies between experiments and previous theories on the buckling of thin cylinders in pure bending can be reasonably explained on the same basis, and that the maximum bending stress can be taken as about 1.4 times the values given by equation buckling problems can probably be explained by similar considerations, and it is hoped that this discussion may help to open a new field in the study of buckling problems . the large-deflection theory developed in the paper should be useful in exploring this field, and may be used in other applications as well .  the paper presents the results of about a hundred new tests of thin cylinders in axial compression and bending, which, together with numerous tests by lundquist, form the experimental evidence for the conclusions arrived at .

249,"Value Conflicts and Social Choice in Electronic Funds Transfer System Developments During the last few years, computer-based systems which automate the transfer and recording of debits and credits have begun to be implemented on a large scale. These systems promise both financial benefits for the institutions that use them and potential conveniences to their customers. However, they also raise significant social, legal, and technical questions that must be resolved if full scale systems for Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) are not to cause more problems for the larger public than they solve. This paper examines the incentives for EFT developments and the social problems they raise in the context of conflicts between five different value positions that are often implicit in analyses of proposed EFT arrangements. These conflicts reflect the relative importance of certain problems for specific groups. The value positions implicit in EFT proposals help to organize analyses of market arrangements, system reliability, and privacy of transactions. These topics are analyzed in this article and related to the value positions held by concerned parties. Last, the ways in which the public can learn about the social qualities of different EFT arrangements and the pace of EFT developments are both discussed in the context of social choice. ",cacm

It forms part of an attempt to construct a formalized general theory of linguistic structure and to explore the foundations of such a theory. The search for rigorous formulation in linguistics has a much more serious motivation than mere concern for logical niceties or the desire to purify well-established methods of linguistic analysis. Precisely constructed models for linguistic structure can play an important role, both negative and positive, in the process of discovery itself. By pushing a precise but inadequate formulation to an unacceptable conclusion, we can often expose the exact source of this inadequacy and, consequently, gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data. More positively, a formalized theory may automatically provide solutions for many problems other than those for which it was explicitly designed. Obscure and intuition-bound notions can neither lead to absurd conclusions nor provide new and correct ones, and hence they fail to be useful in two important respects. ",cisi

In 1967, Olaf Helmer, then Senior Mathematician at the Rand corporation, forecast that scientists and engineers would increase from five million, in 1967, to twenty-five million by the year 2000 and their total productivity would go up by a factor of ten. He declined to assess the associated growth of, and need for, scientific information but merely stated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which science would actually be transacted. It is these 'substantial changes' that concern the publisher, editor, information scientist and librarian, because if we do not anticipate - or at least keep pace with these changes - then we will not be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will become redundant. Scientific information is a growing industry and it would be ironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information. I regard the chance to do something about the flow of information as a response to opportunity, not as an act of desperation. The big problem is to sort out what is pertinent among this information and, in this world of rapid change, select and develop the technological devices that will match the needs of the scientist to this mass of information.

Fixed-head drum and moving-head drum and moving-head disk storage units are considered, and emphasis is placed on the relative merits of the MTPT scheduling discipline with respect to the shortest-latency-time-first (SLTF) scheduling discipline. The results of the simulation studies presented show that neither scheduling discipline is unconditionally superior to the other. For most fixed-head drum applications, the SLTF discipline is preferable to MTPT, but for intra-cylinder disk scheduling the MTPT discipline offers a distinct advantage over the SLTF discipline. The computational requirements of an algorithm that implements the MTPT scheduling discipline are shown to be comparable to SLTF algorithms. In both cases, the sorting procedure is the most time-consuming phase of the algorithm. ",cacm

It is shown that carefully designed matrix algorithms can lead to enormous savings in the number of page faults occurring when only a small part of the total matrix can be in main memory at one time. Examination of addition, multiplication, and inversion algorithms shows that a partitioned matrix representation (i.e. one submatrix or partition per page) in most cases induced fewer page faults than a row-by-row representation.  The number of page-pulls required by these matrix manipulation algorithms is also studied as a function of the number of pages of main memory available to the algorithm. ",cacm

The banking information system now serves the two-fold purpose of providing real-time responses to inquires about individual account stasus and providing more complex combinations of information for management use. Both kinds of processing draw upon a common store of data contained in the direct access central file. This data base includes indexes which facilitate cross referencing of account information so that all relationships between bank and customer may be discerned. In introducing the banking information system concept, a gradual approach to account cross-referencing and file conversion is most prudent.

The ability to condition the supply of information on its intended use is called here ""intentional resolution"" of privacy protection. The practical importance of intentional resolution is demonstrated by several examples, and its realization is discussed. It is shown that intentional resolution can be achieved, but that it involves a radical change from the traditional approach to the process of user-database interaction. In particular, it appears to be necessary for the database to impose a certain amount of control over the internal behavior of users' programs which interact with it.

6732,"the effect of actinomycin d on parathyroid-induced change in bone and kidney. actinomycin d (amd), an antibiotic known to inhibit dna-directed rna synthesis, was used to study parathyroid-induced changes in ca mobilization in vivo and in vitro as well as renal excretion of ca and phosphate in rats. intact and parathyroidectomized rats subjected to peritoneal lavage were administered amd, and changes in ca, p, and mg in lavage and serum were examined. amd consistently lowered the ca transfer into the peritoneal rinse in both the intact and parathyroidectomized animals, although the drop in ca was more acute if the animals were pretreated by subcutaneous injections of amd than if amd was administered as a component of the rinse. pretreatment of lavaged animals with amd prevented the expected increase in osteoclast numbers in the distal metaphysis of the femur but had no effect if administered as a component of the peritoneal rinse. the incubation of femora removed from both intact and parathyroidectomized animals resulted in media ca levels that were significantly lower after 4 hr. incubation when amd was added in vitro. however, transfer of recently injected ca into the incubation medium from animals treated with amd was increased. in addition, parathyroidectomy of animals subsequent to administration of amd still resulted in expected changes in ca and p in the urine although amd significantly increased p excretion in both intact and parathyroidectomized animals. it was concluded that endogenous parathyroid hormone requires the continuous production of enzymes ultimately responsible for its action on bone and kidney, but that this action is not necessarily related directly to the production of m-rna.

7083,"renal factors in the pathogenesis of hypertension renal arteriography and other modern diagnostic procedures have provided the means of establishing a close relationship between high blood pressure and renovascular disease. many of these cases are amenable to surgical cure. at the present time there is no single test for the definitive diagnosis of renal hypertension. careful and intensive studies are mandatory in the selection of cases suitable for surgery, since hypertension has many etiologic factors and involves many complex and sometimes obscure mechanisms. aortography, intravenous urography and split-function tests are among the most important methods for definitive diagnosis and for the planning of appropriate surgical procedures. at operation, the most commonly observed cause of renal arterial con- striction in the elderly is atherosclerosis, whereas in younger patients it is hyperplasia of the intimal and muscular coats of the renal artery and its branches. renovascular surgery may require a variety of technical procedures. in the successful cases there is a striking and permanent reduction in blood pressure. the accuracy of blood pressure readings is emphasized, since hypertension is usually discovered for the first time during the course of a routine physical examination.

1998,"Topological Sorting of Large Networks Topological Sorting is a procedure required for many problems involving analysis of networks.  An example of one such problem is PERT. The present paper presents a very general method for obtaining topological order. It permits treatment of larger networks than can be handled on present procedures and achieves this with greater efficiency. Although the procedure can be adapted to any machine, it is discussed in terms of the 7090. A PERT network of 30,000 activities can be ordered in less than one hour of machine time. The method was developed as a byproduct of procedures needed by Westinghouse, Baltimore. It has not been programmed and at present there are no plans to implement it. In regard to the techniques described, Westinghouse's present and anticipated needs are completely served by the Lockheed program, which is in current use. ",cacm

2155,"Cellular Arrays for the Solution of Graph Problems A cellular array is a two-dimensional, checkerboard type interconnection of identical modules (or cells), where each cell contains a few bits of memory and a small amount of combinational logic, and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors in the array. The chief computational advantage offered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speed achieved by virtue of the possibilities for parallel processing. In this paper it is shown that cellular arrays are inherently well suited for the solution of many graph problems. For example, the adjacency matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array, and typical row and column operations are readily implemented by simple cell logic. A major challenge in the effective use of cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently serial. In particular, several parallelized algorithms are presented for the solution of certain spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis, and the analysis of many types of networks.  These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, where n is the number of nodes in the graph. Straightforward cellular implementations of the well-known serial algorithms for these problems require about n steps, and noncellular implementations require from n^2 to n^3 steps. ",cacm

Two different types of storage fragmentation are distinguished: (1) external fragmentation, namely the loss in storage utilization caused by the inability to make use of all available storage after it has been fragmented into a large number of separate blocks; and (2) internal fragmentation, the loss of utilization caused by rounding up a request for storage, rather than allocating only the exact number of words required.  The most striking result is the apparently general rule that rounding up requests for storage, to reduce the number of different sizes of blocks coexisting in storage, causes more loss of storage by increased internal fragmentation than is saved by decreased external fragmentation. Described also are a method of segment allocation and an accompanying technique for segment addressing which take advantage of the above result. Evidence is presented of possible advantages of the method over conventional paging techniques. ",cacm

Calibration experiments are conducted to determine expressions relating the synthetic program parameters with the workload characteristics.

2287,"A Simple Proof of Lewin's Ordered-Retrieval Theorem for Associative Memories An efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary words from an associative memory, as described by Lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits which indicate the digit values present in the individual digit columns of the memory. Thus the circuits indicate whether the individual digit columns contain digits of both values, or of only one value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the memory is empty). The use of these circuits, which in this paper are termed column value indicators, reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary to retrieve in order a number of distinct words from the memory. Lewin proves that, for the readout by the described method of m distinct binary words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary. (Thus he proves that the number of necessary memory accesses of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent of the word length.)

In this model, program behavior is represented by the LRU stack distance model and the PFF replacement algorithm is represented by a semi-Markov model. Using these models, such parameters as the inter-page-fault interval distribution, the probability of the number of distinct pages being referenced during an inter-page-fault interval, etc. are able to be analytically determined. Using these models to evaluate these parameter values permits study of the performance of the replacement algorithm by simulating the page fault events rather than every page reference event.

1019,"On the External Storage Fragmentation Produced by First-Fit and Best-Fit Allocation Strategies Published comparisons of the external fragmentation produced by first-fit and best-fit memory allocation have not been consistent. Through simulation, a series of experiments were performed in order to obtain better data on the relative performance of first-fit and best-fit and a better understanding of the reasons underlying observed differences. The time-memory-product efficiencies of first-fit and best-fit were generally within 1 to 3 percent of each other. Except for small populations, the size of the request population had little effect on allocation efficiency. For exponential and hyperexponential distributions of requests, first-fit outperformed best-fit; but for normal and uniform distributions, and for exponential distributions distorted in various ways, best-fit outperformed first-fit. It is hypothesized that when first-fit outperforms best-fit, it does so because first-fit, by preferentially allocating toward one end of memory, encourages large blocks to grow at the other end. Sufficient contiguous space is thereby more likely to be available for relatively large requests. Results of simulation experiments supported this hypothesis and showed that the relative performance of first-fit and best-fit depends on the frequency of request. When the coefficient of variation of the request distribution is greater than or approximately equal to unity, first-fit outperformed best-fit. ",cacm

The target audiences for these two systems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the other policy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and social development.

No attempt can be made to evaluate in other than general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a system may have. It can be readily demonstrated, however, that computer-assisted information systems may make sense within individual institutional environments, and make greater sense when on-line systems linking various collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operate more efficiently and at lower cost. The existence of such on-line networks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibility of having access at a reasonable price to large information stores. ",cisi

2227,"An Interactive Software System for Computers-Aided Design: An Application to Circuit Project The characteristics of an interactive software system, intended to constitute an interface between designer and computer during various steps of the design process, are presented. The main emphasis is given to the description of the features of the two high level user oriented languages, operating at different levels, on which the interaction is based. The first one is IMOL, an interactive monitor language, which is designed to perform the overall and control functions of the software system; its design criteria provide the user with commands which are both simple and efficient in order to perform all the functions needed in computer-aided circuit design. The second one is COIF, a circuit oriented graphic language, which is designed to describe, generate, and manipulate graphic problem specifications; it is an extension of Fortran with graphic-type variables, so that the designer who is familiar with Fortran need not learn a new language. The application to computer-aided circuit design is in particular examined; on the other hand, the adopted design criteria provide sufficient generality to extend the use of the two languages to different computer-assisted applications.

2942,"Shallow Binding in Lisp 1.5 Shallow binding is a scheme which allows the value of a variable to be accessed in a bounded amount of computation. An elegant model for shallow binding in Lisp 1.5 is presented in which context-switching is an environment tree transformation called rerooting.  Rerooting is completely general and reversible, and is optional in the sense that a Lisp 1.5 interpreter will operate correctly whether or not rerooting is invoked one very context change.  Since rerooting leaves assoc [v, a] invariant, for all variables v and all environments a, the programmer can have access to a rerooting primitive, shallow[], which gives him dynamic control over whether accesses are shallow or deep, and which affects only the speed of execution of a program, not its semantics. In addition, multiple processes can be active in the same environment structure, so long as rerooting is an indivisible operation.  Finally, the concept of rerooting is shown to combine the concept of shallow binding in Lisp with Dijkstra's display for Algol and hence is a general model for shallow binding. ",cacm

More generally, any data structure may be implicit; i.e. it may be specified by giving an arbitrary algorithm for computing or accessing its components.

A resource management program is described which uses linked lists along with other techniques to overcome a large portion of this overhead. The program, which is currently running as part of a large scale general purpose operating system, keeps resources relatively active but does not detect or prevent all deadlocks in its implemented state. Certain changes, which would permit more comprehensive levels of deadlock prevention/detection at additional cost, have not been incorporated in the running system due to the infrequency of deadlock situations.

3973,"A New Look at Reference Scattering  It was first observed by Bradford that, for a large collection of journal references on a given subject, most of the articles are derived from a small proportion of the total titles. Bradford listed the journals concerned in order of decreasing productivity and, by plotting the logarithms of the cumulative totals of titles against the cumulative totals of relevant articles produced, he obtained a straight line. (Similar results have been obtained by many later workers. The pattern is illustrated by Table I which shows the distribution of references among journal titles obtained by the author during a study of literature usage in the petroleum industry.) On the basis of these results Bradford then formulated a simple mathematical model to describe reference scattering. Vickery later pointed out that this 'law of scattering' predicted not a straight line but a curve. Kendall has now provided a more refined statistical explanation of the straight line observed by Bradford. ",cisi
2636,"One Way of Estimating Frequencies of Jumps in a Program For the segmentation of a program it is useful to have a reasonable estimation of the values of S(ij), where S(ij) is the mean value of the number of jumps from the i-th instruction on to the j-th instruction in the run time. In the cases where the S(ij) are estimated directly, the structure of the whole program must be generally taken into account; therefore it is very difficult for the programmer and/or the translator to obtain a good estimation of the S(ij). It is easier to estimate not S(ij) but the quantities P(ij)=S(ij)*C(i)/SUM[S(ij), j=1,N], where C(i) is an arbitrary positive constant for each i. Although the P(ij) are, for each i, proportional to S(ij), the estimation of P(ij) is easier, because we must estimate only the ""probabilities"" of events where instruction i is executed after instruction I(i). This estimation can often be done without considering the structure of the whole program. In the first part of the paper, using the theory of the Markov chains, an algorithm for the computation of the S(ij) from the P(ij) is found, and some ways of obtaining estimates of the P(ij) are given. In the second part a variant of this algorithm is derived, avoiding the necessity of computation involving large matrices. ",cacm

The virtue of these axioms is that they permit a representation-independent formal specification of a data type. An example is given which shows how to employ algebraic axioms at successive levels of implementation. The major thrust of the paper is twofold. First, it is shown how the use of algebraic axiomatizations can simplify the process of proving the correctness of an implementation of an abstract data type. Second, semi-automatic tools are described which can be used both to automate such proofs of correctness and to derive an immediate implementation from the axioms. This implementation allows for limited testing of programs at design time, before a conventional implementation is accomplished. ",cacm

They will observe that long after the sociology of science became an identifiable field of inquiry, it remained little cultivated in a world where science loomed large enough to present mankind with the choice of destruction or survival. They may even suggest that somewhere in the process by which social scientists take note of the world as it is and as it once was, a sense of values appears to have become badly scrambled. ",cisi

1184,"Pictorial Pattern Recognition and the Phase Problem of X-ray Crystallography The availability of interactive, three-dimensional, computer graphics systems coupled to powerful digital computers encourages the development of algorithms adapted to this environment. Pictorial pattern recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches to X-ray structure determination based on molecular model building, i.e. the use of chemical information to frame ""structural hypotheses"" which can computationally be tested and refined by reference to the experimental data. Application of standard pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact that the cross-correlation between a model and the correct structure cannot be computed because of a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data.  However, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such a cross-correlation. A simple example demonstrates that this information can be the basis of a technique for structure determination that can make effective use of an interactive graphics system. Model building by cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages over usual crystallographic techniques based on the autocorrelation or Patterson function, especially for large structures. This is significant, for crystallography of biological macromolecules hasbeen and will continue to be a field of intense interest. ",cacm

349,"The Teachable Language Comprehender: A Simulation Program and Theory of Language The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program designed to be capable of being taught to ""comprehend"" English text. When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory.  This memory is a ""semantic network"" representing factual assertions about the world. The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text. By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory. In this form it can be added into the memory. Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed.  TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided. Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind. The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future.  Thus the addition of a single factual assertion or linguistic capability will often provide a large increment in TLC's effective knowledge of the world and in its overall ability to comprehend text. The program's strategy is presented as a general theory of language comprehension. ",cacm

(these assumptions may be compared with the empirical relations suggested by cope .) it is shown that a transformation of the ordinate normal to the layer can lead to a simplified form of equation of motion very similar to the ordinary incompressible equation but modified by a multiplicative factor g in the pressure term . this factor is greater than unity at the boundary and tends to one at the outside of the layer .  several particular solutions are considered including accelerated flow with a linearly increasing velocity and retarded flow along a flat plate with a linearly decreasing velocity .  the general implications of the theory are discussed and qualitative conclusions are drawn when the mainstream velocity starts from a stagnation point, rises to a maximum and subsequently falls . it is concluded that for such a velocity distribution increasing compressibility will reduce the skin friction, increase the boundary layer thickness and cause earlier separation as compared with the incompressible flow with the same mainstream velocity distribution and the kinematic viscosity corresponding to conditions at the stagnation point .

There are a number of possible reasons for this. Social scientists, faced with a much smaller total volume of information, were much less information-conscious and less inclined to seek for solutions. There are very few specialist libraries in the social sciences, and few librarians were therefore confronted with social scientists' information needs in the same way as librarians in scientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems. Finally, until OSTI came along there was little in the way of funds to support this kind of research. This almost total absence of previous research had its disadvantages and advantages. There were very few clues to guide us, and we were therefore working to a certain extent in the dark. On the other hand, we had a clean and open field uncorrupted by confusing and non-comparable studies. There is something to be said for being one of the first in a field. ",cisi

The purpose of this paper is to help clarify the concept and discuss it in the context of the librarian's conventional planning and administrative activities. This is done through a narration of the step-by-step procedures followed in the conceptualization and design of an actual library and information program. The steps involved are the following: definition of the purpose of the program, and financial and administrative constraints on its design and operation, as envisaged by management; a user study to determine needs and preferences of the presumed audience of the program; analysis and definition of program performance requirements; selection of methods and mechanisms for implementing performance requirements; conceptualization and documentation of program design; evaluation of design; modification and completion of design. Two basic principles that are discussed and emphasized are the need to define what the program should be doing and what it should not be doing, and the need and means for determining real as opposed to apparent costs in the design process.

5634,"on the bending of a clamped plate . on the bending of a clamped plate .  the present paper contains an application of a recently developed variational method to the boundary value problem of the bending of a clamped plate of arbitrary shape . it will be shown that this problem can be linked to the simpler problem of the equilibrium of a membrane by a chain of intermediate problems, which can be solved explicitly and in finite form in terms of the membrane problem . in the intermediate problems, the deflection converges uniformly in the domain of the plate of the clamped plate, and the derivatives of all orders of the deflection converge uniformly in every domain completely interior to the plate . (in the ritz method, not even the convergence of the slopes can be guaranteed .) the method yields numerical results for plates of all shapes for which the membrane problem (which we shall call the base problem) admits an explicit solution . as an example we shall consider a clamped square plate under a uniform load . this problem has been the object of numerous investigations, some of which are theoretical, while others are purely numerical, use infinite simple and double series, and operate with an infinite number of linear equations and an infinite number of unknowns . an inspection of the general formulae derived in the present paper, formulae which become simple in numerical applications, would show how some of the numerical methods might be rendered rigorous . the convergence of higher derivatives is of great practical interest for the approximate computation of the stresses .

7013,"insulin and protein metabolism the present status of protein synthesis within cells has been outlined. protein is formed in the absence of insulin; the net formation of protein is accelerated by insulin. the effects of insulin on protein metabolism take place independently of the transport of glucose or amino acids into the cell; of glycogen synthesis; and of the stimulation of high energy phosphate formation. in the case of protein metabolism, as in certain studies on the pathways of glucose and fat metabolism, these observations reveal striking intracellular effects of insulin in many tissues. within most tissues the effect of insulin appears to find expression predominantly at the microsomal level. incidentally, other hormones which affect protein metabolism such as growth or sex hormones appear to act at the microsomes. the fact that insulin exerts effects on protein metabolism at other intracellular sites as well as the above independent effects leads one to agree that its action consists of a stimulation of multiple, seemingly unrelated, metabolic events. the fact that an immediate effect of insulin on protein synthesis is independent of the immediate need for extracellular glucose or amino acids does not mean that the sustained functioning of cells is likewise independent. the biochemist is fully aware of metabolic defects in diabetes which are not altered by insulin in vitro, but which demand varying periods of pretreatment of the animal. it is also known that in diabetes some proteins (enzymes) may be deficient while others may be produced in excess in the absence of insulin. it is suggested that the physician desires at least two kinds of relation between these fundamental studies and his patients. one is the possible relation of a deficiency of insulin action to pathological processes in tissues which have not as yet been examined by the methods described. the other is the need for more accurate measurements of the metabolic disorder and its control than such things as urinary and blood glucose. in developing such future improvements, the place of insulin in protein biosynthesis must be kept in mind.

6013,"on the flow in a reflected shock tunnel . on the flow in a reflected shock tunnel . the performance of a shock tunnel operated by the reflected-shock technique is examined theoretically neglecting viscous effects and high-temperature real-gas effects . particular attention is given to disturbances to the flow at the nozzle entry caused by waves reflected from  the contact surface when the operating conditions depart from those for that the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is weak enough to be tolerated only within a small range of primary-shock mach number, m /e.g., 5 7 m 6 3 if the pressure at entry to the nozzle is to remain constant to 10 per cent/ . within this range, running times much longer than those obtained in 'straight-through' shock tunnels are predicted, the limitation usually being imposed by the arrival of the expansion wave originating at the diaphragm . outside this range of mach number, the uniform-flow duration between the  arrival at the nozzle entry of the primary shock and the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is shown to be approximately  equal to the time between the arrival of the primary shock and the contact surface in a 'straight-through' shock tunnel . at first sight it  appears, therefore, that the advantages of reflected-shock operation are confined to a very narrow range of shock mach number, unless a heated driver gas is used in order to vary the mach number for further analysis suggests, however, that subsequent disturbances in the multiple wave reflection process between the contact surface and the end  of the tube are relatively weak over a useful range of shock mach number . thus, if the flow after the arrival of the early reflected disturbances is used for test purposes, long running times seem possible in  theory without severe restrictions to the shock mach number . experiments have been made in a shock tube and a shock tunnel to provide data for comparisons with the results of the simple theory . if allowance is made for viscous effects on the motion of the contact surface, fair agreement is found for the disturbances reflected and transmitted by the contact surface, and for the arrival of the expansion wave reflection process increases when the shock mach number is raised substantially above the 'tailored' value, and a limit to the usable flow duration may result . a striking feature of the results is a fall of pressure at the end of the tube immediately after reflection of the primary shock . this is attributed to attenuation of the reflected shock resulting from its interaction with the boundary layer on the wall of the tube . further research is required to check this explanation, and to investigate the effects of reynolds number and of the cross-sectional shape and size of the tube . the effects of the tail and reflected head of the expansion wave originating at the main diaphragm are discussed . it is shown that the arrival of the reflected head at the nozzle entry may impose a severe limitation to the duration of uniform conditions at low shock mach number, and that the arrival of the tail may limit the flow duration at high shock mach number . unless means can be devised to suppress the expansion wave, it is demonstrated that it is desirable to have alternative diaphragm positions in a tube required to operate over a range of shock mach number . it is concluded that running times of order 10 milliseconds at a shock mach number of 4, falling to, perhaps, 1 millisecond at a shock mach number of 8 seem possible in a shock tunnel of reasonable size by using reflected-shock operation with unheated hydrogen driving air . because of the simplifying assumptions of the theoretical investigations, and the deficiencies of the apparatus used for the experiments, the present investigation must, however, be regarded as preliminary in character . further research is required to check and extend the findings, and topics particularly requiring investigation are listed in the paper .

Compared to other types of societies, this one demands a wider variety of higher level skills and thus generates much pressure against the forces that in all societies tend to keep the individual in his original caste or class. Much of the resulting mobility is based on a radical change which has taken place in the occupational structure of modern industrial societies, one which neither Marx nor orthodox economists anticipated, an expansion of the demand for professional and technical skills of a high order.  Thus not only are individuals competing with one another in their efforts to rise in the class system, but occupations, too, are engaged in the same competition and may move up or down in power, prestige, or income.

In order to solve the normal equations and evaluate the precision measures of the resulting parameters, inversion of this matrix of coefficients is required. Many available procedures for matrix inversion do not take advantage of the symmetry. Thus, when programmed for a high-speed computer, all n^2 elements must be stored and manipulated, whereas only (n + 1)/2 of them are independent.  In order to allow a computer of given memory capacity to handle a larger matrix, the following procedure for inverting a symmetric matrix has been devised. ",cacm

5551,"on the flow of compressible fluid past an obstacle . on the flow of compressible fluid past an obstacle . it is well known that according to classical hydrodynamics a steady stream of frictionless incompressible fluid exercises no resultant force upon an obstacle, such as a rigid sphere, immersed in it . the development of a /resistance/ is usually attributed to viscosity, or when there is a sharp edge to the negative pressure which may accompany it (helmholtz) . in either case it would seem that resistance involves something of the nature of a wake, extending behind the obstacle to an infinite distance . when the system of disturbed velocities, although it may mathematically extend to infinity, remains as it were attached to the obstacle, there can be no resistance . the absence of resistance is asserted for an incompressible fluid., but it can hardly be supposed that a small degree of compressibility, as in water, would affect the conclusion . on the other hand, high relative velocities, exceeding that of sound in the fluid, must entirely alter the conditions . it seems worth while to examine this question more closely, especially as the first effects of compressibility are amenable to mathematical treatment .

The virtues of these systems are speed, intimacy, and - if time-sharing is involved - economy.. The major problems are the cost of the large computers and files necessary for bibliographic data, the still- high cost of communications, and the generally poor design of the user- system interfaces.. The desirable features of on-line retrieval interfaces are only now being defined and tested in a systematic way, e.g., by the National Library of Medicine in its AIM-TWX nationwide experimental retrieval service.. System implementers must, in addition to engineering the right capabilities into on-line systems, also make a careful, concerted effort to engineer user acceptance.. Common pitfalls here include overselling system capabilities and failure to take into account the social context around the user terminal.. The major national problem is to avoid or limit wasteful and expensive duplication in providing nationwide search access to the hundreds of public and private data bases that will be readily available during the next few years..

7068,"cell proliferation in compensatory renal growth rats with one kidney removed showed a progressive increase in weight of the remaining kidney over a six-week period. autoradiographic and radiochemical studies with 3h-thymidine indicated that the increase in new kidney cell formation was maximal forty-eight to seventy-two hours after unilateral nephrectomy. this early response was chiefly due to the production of new cells by the renal cortical tubules. normal rates of tubule cell turnover were achieved two weeks after operation. the glomerular tufts contained fewer new cells and their peak production was delayed to the one-week period with a slow decline thereafter. rats forty-eight hours after unilateral nephrectomy were chosen as a model to study the effect of various substances on the magnitude of new cell formation. the number of dna-synthesising cells in the stimulated kidney was reduced by treatment with hydrocortisone, acth, 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene, and 1,2-benzanthracene; the numbers were increased by the administration of deoxycorticosterone and aldosterone.

4211,"Characteristics of the Research Literature Used by Chemists and Physicists in the United States  The increasing growth and complexities of research libraries are natural consequences of the growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of knowledge. Librarians have tried to amass more and more knowledge in the form of books for the benefit of the diverse interests of their clienteles. Their success in this activity has been reflected in the increasing difficulties of identifying satisfactorily what they have. The processes of cataloging, classifying, and related technical routines have become increasingly complex and expensive. The processes are of such a nature that the cost for adding each new item to a large library is, on the average, potentially if not actually, higher than that for its predecessor. The total proportion of the budgets of large research libraries that is spent for the processing of material, as distinguished from the costs of its purchase or its direct servicing, is now such as to give librarians pause for fear a day may come when nearly all the money available to large libraries will be spent in processing material, and little will be left to service the collection or to buy new books!

473,"Automated Printed Circuit Routing with a Stepping Aperture A computer program for routing interconnections on a two-sided printed circuit board with a regular pattern of lines, pins (terminals), and vias (feed-through holes) is described. In this program, each interconnection is given a planned routing-typically, down from the upper pin, through a via, and horizontally to the lower pin. From the top, a virtual aperture (i.e. a long horizontal slit) is stepped down the board. The planned routing is the basis for rerouting interconnections within the aperture to resolve conflicts for lines and vias below the aperture and to maximize the effective line usage.  If a conflict has not been resolved before the aperture arrives at the lower pin,interconnections are deleted to resolve the conflict. Extensions of this technique to the control of crosstalk between routed interconnections and to the problem of obtaining 100 percent interconnect are also discussed. ",cacm

Thus a basis for comparisons and for judgements has been introduced which provides a foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programs of service to the disadvantaged might move.  To achieve the study objectives, library programs and practices in low-income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities. In each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview and observation in four subject areas: (1) the needs and interests of the community residents, (2) library services in relation to other available community resources, (3) the nature and scope of the neighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of the library system, and (4) available measures of the impact or effectiveness of the program.

6629,"1770. proliferative activity of the lymphatic tissues of rats as studied with tritium-labelled thymidine cytokinetic data are presented, employing quantitation of h3dna in the lymphatic tissues of normal rats serially sacrificed after h3tdr administration. a marked difference in the patterns of initial labeling and label loss was observed between the thymus and peripheral lymphatic tissue. the data are compatible with other indica- tions of rapid cell renewal in the thymus. there is suppression of initial uptake of h3tdr into the dna of each large lymphocytic progenitor cell in the thymus, appa- rently because of a feedback of thymidine containing material from small lympho- cytes in the thymus. depletion of the thymus of small cells, as by operative stress or whole body x-ray, leads to a marked increase in the uptake of h3tdr into the dna of large thymocytes. this finding, which is in agreement with the previous findings of sugino et al. suggesting transfer of thymine nucleotides from small thy- mus lymphocytes to precursor cells, may or may not be related to the apparent transfer of dna label between thymic cells. the evidence for the latter consists of the curvilinear dilution of the dna label in the thymus proliferating cell population and the relationship between the rate of dna label dilution in large cells and the dna in the small cells in the thymus. after the dna label in progenitor cells in the thymus and lymph nodes has entered the small cell population, the subsequent dilution of grains in these dividing cells follows the same slope as the loss of radio- activity from the entire lymph node. there is a long retention of some h3dna label in the dividing lymph node cell population. this suggests that the loss of radioacti- vity from the dividing cells and from the small cell population as a whole occurs e- qually. this pattern prevails regardless of whether the percentage of large and small cells is altered experimentally. these findings can be explained by an inter- change of the dna nuclear label between small lymphocytes and large lymphocytes. this could occur by some process such as phagocytosis or pinocytosis, or by trans- formation of the small lymphocyte into a large, dividing cell. the data fit best with the latter possibility. all or any of these mechanisms would lead to an equilibration of the dna label between large and small cells. this finding prevents the assign- ment of a finite life span to lymphocytes on the basis of dna labeling kinetics. ne- vertheless, there appear to be at least two different types of lymphocytes. one, the 'thymus-type' lymphocyte, is found in the thymus cortex, bone marrow and ger- minal centers of lymphoid follicles. the other type, found abundantly in the wide- spread peripheral lymphatic tissue, shows a very prolonged retention of dna la- bel and is believed to be recirculating, 'immunologically committed' cells described by others. these cells do not appear to enter the thymus cortex.

4399,"Generation and Uses of Machine-Readable Data Bases  This chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use of machine-readable data bases inaugurated in Volume 9 by Williams (178). It is therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared in general accordance with Williams's initial compilation.  The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications used in Volume 9 are continued this year. A data base is considered to be an organized collection of machine-readable records containing bibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information). The data bases that we will consider are used for information storage and retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval or data base generation.  The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas. First, data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic information, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded. Thus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number is a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such as that by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39) are excluded. Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic material is included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, most of the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a shipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this chapter. Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generation of publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that production operation. ",cisi

Both analytical and simulation results are obtained.  The variance of waiting time is introduced as another meaningful measure of performance, showing possible discrimination against individual requests.  Then the choice of a utility function to measure total performance including system oriented and individual request oriented measures is described. Such a function allows one to differentiate among the scheduling policies over a wide range of input loading conditions.  The selection and implementation of a maximum performance two-policy algorithm are discussed. ",cacm
3995,"What Makes An Automatic Keyword Classification Effective?   Though the idea of constructing a keyword classification for retrieval purposes automatically is not a new one, comparatively few systematic experiments have been carried out in this area; and while many suggestions have been put forward, not enough is known about the behaviour of automatic keyword classifications, and hence about the properties such classifications should have and the ways they should be used.. In previous experiments we showed that some forms of classification could give good results, and this paper describes a further series of tests designed to examine this sort of classification in more detail, with a view to establishing the optimum forms of classification and procedures for using them in different retrieval situations.. These tests demonstrate that further improvements in performance over that for unclassified keywords can be obtained, and that definite conclusions can be drawn about the correct approach to classification for collections like the test one: the best results are given when grouping is confined to strongly connected, nonfrequent keywords, when the classification is used to provide additional rather than alternative indexing terms, particularly for requests, and when matching is controlled by keyword frequency..

1734,"On the Optimal Detection of Curves in Noisy Pictures A technique for recognizing systems of lines is presented. In this technique the heuristic of the problem is not embedded in the recognition algorithm but is expressed in a figure of merit.  A multistage decision process is then able to recognize in the input picture the optimal system of lines according to the given figure of merit. Due to the global approach, greater flexibility and adequacy in the particular problem is achieved. The relation between the structure of the figure of merit and the complexity of the optimization process is then discussed.  The method described is suitable for parallel processing because the operations relative to each state can be computed in parallel, and the number of stages is equal to the length N of the curves (or to log2 N if the approximate method is used).

Rudolf Kaiser sums up the argument between the classed and the dictionary catalog by stating that a library needs both and explaining that the subject index fills the need as far as an alphabetical catalog is concerned. However, his conclusion misses the mark, since, for one not completely the master of the system of classification, there is no approach to the classed catalog save through an index, yet the index is not in fact as complete and direct a guide to the subject content of the library's collections as an alphabetical catalog rationally and fully cross-referenced.

The first, of primarily theoretical interest, shows that without cell tag bits the task can be performed in time n^2. The second algorithm, assuming one tag bit in each cell, delivers attractive practical speed.  Any noncyclic structure is copied in linear speed, while cyclic structures are copied in average time less than nlogn. No foreknowledge of cycle absence is necessary to achieve linear speed. A variation of the second algorithm solves an open problem concerning list structure marking. That result demonstrates that marking can be done in average time nlogn without the aid of supplemental tag bits or stacks. ",cacm

The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology. The extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence of the above four components. The research methodology includes procedures for the compilation of the required dictionaries, the setting of the control parameters, and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts with manually produced extracts. The results indicate that the three newly proposed components dominate the frequency component in the production of better extracts.

Archives were the forerunners of libraries. The ancient archives contained the best of society's accumulated knowledge; and as nations grew in wealth and security, archives and libraries become symbols of a country's aspiration to create a better society. Today, archives and libraries are necessities. These cultural institutions pass information to succeeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media. In this way, archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and pass this memory on to living individuals.

4292,"A Note on the Pseudo-Mathematics of Relevance  Recently a number of articles, books, and reports dealing with information systems, i.e., document retrieval systems, have advanced the doctrine that such systems are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage of relevancy they provide.  Although there seems to be little agreement on what relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable, there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed and formal relationship exists between the relevance and the recall performance of any system. Thus, we will find in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of relevance as reported by individual users, and equations, curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide numerical measures of the recall and relevance characteristics of information systems. This phenomenon of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective and non-mathematical term to equations in which the same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical definition has its ancient parallel in discussions of probability. One cannot, of course, legislate the meaning of a term. It all depends, as Alice pointed out, on ""who is master,"" the user or the term. On the other hand, the use of a single term in the same document to cover two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does not have, represents a more serious situation than merely careless ambiguity.

These program portions are transferred between executable and peripheral storage whenever necessary; segmentation of program s in a manner that reduces the frequency of such transfers is the subject of this paper. Segmentation techniques proposed by C. V.

Most of these systems are also capable of handling certain fragment requests; however, the fragments which can be processed are frequently of a restricted nature.

This technique is novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking ad restarting required by other atom-by-atom matching procedures.

4572,"A Study of the Usage and Retention of Technical Periodicals  Limited physical space expansion, an administrative consideration in every library, becomes a stringent factor in the planning of special libraries. While public and college libraries may have  several decades of growth possibility when they take possession of a building or area, it is indeed a fortunate industrial library whose stacks are not overcrowded after five years of establishment in new quarters. Industrial floorspace is too greatly in demand to devote more effort to the possible future growth of the library.	Weeding or storage requirements, therefore, are far more immediate considerations to the special industrial library administrators than they are to administrators of other types of libraries. The limits of expansion are usually apparent earliest in the serials collections of industrial libraries because so much current technical data is published first in scientific and technical periodicals. These collections grow rapidly. This summarization of a recent study made by one technical library in the area of space for use of technical journals has potential for other libraries. ",cisi
3777,"Classification Catalogue Code  The Author, the Dictionary and the Classified catalogues represent three successive stages in the order of evolution of the internal form of the Library Catalogue. The classified form being the latest to evolve, the literature relating to it is comparatively scanty. It is strikingly so in the form of a systematic code of rules for cataloguing. While the number of codes for the Author Catalogue is fairly large and the number for the Dictionary Catalogue is also respectable, there appear to be few systematic and complete codes published in book-form for the Classified Catalogue. Hence this little venture, which is based on twenty-five years of experimentation and on the valuable reciprocal influence gained by its being taught to students of library science during the last twenty years.  While the Call Numbers occurring in the examples given are constructed by the Colon Classification, the rules of this Code are not necessarily dependent on that scheme for their applicability. They are all of general application, irrespective of the scheme of classification in use. ",cisi

4010,"Morphology of ""Information Flow""  Such phrases as ""information flow"" may be purely metaphorical, or may refer to porterage and storage of physical documents, transmission of signals, power required for signaling, Shannon's Selective Information, changes in the state of one's personal knowledge, propagation of announcements concerning messages, social increase of awareness, propagation of or reaction to imperatives, and so on. These matters are distinct and must be distinguished. Then conditions must be stated under which one can validly speak of and measure the appropriate flow. In this paper it is shown that within the field of Notification (mention and delivery of recorded messages to users) there are twenty basic activities formed by choosing triads from the six variables, Message, Code, Channel, Source, Destination, and Designation.  ""Flow"" has meaning only when two such triads have two variables in common, forming a tetrad. Then flow or correspondence between any pair of variables is inextricable from a conjugate flow or correspondence between the other pair. Between any pair of endpoints there are six possibly distinct types of flow, according to which two of the remaining four variables are directly used to achieve the flow. ",cisi

Several on-line systems for general purpose mathematical problem solving have already been implemented as well as some special purpose systems for solving problems in a particular area such as ordinary differential equations. The advantage of restricting the problem area is that the interface with a user can be greatly simplified.

If this particular area is full, then the entry will be placed into the slower second-level store, even though other areas in the first-level store may have space available. Given the N entries have been filed in the entire hierarchy, an expression is derived for the expected number of entries filed in the first-level store.This expression gives a measure of how effectively the first-level store is being used.

Utilization of a thesaurus in an information system involves a set of    rules which take into account the characteristics of the system. ,cisi
2304,"A Lightpen-Controlled Program For On-Line Data Analysis This paper describes a technique designed to ease the use of a data processing system by a person, in particular, a scientist, who is intimately and primarily concerned with interpreting the significance of data handled by the system. Since such a person is often unable to spend the time necessary to master a programming language, it is essential that he be aided in composing commands to the computer. In the system described, the user is not required to learn or remember the vocabulary of the language because the vocabulary is displayed before him on""menus"" by means of a computer-drive scope. He selects the various vocabulary elements required by pointing with the light pen. By use of a small unordered set of rewriting rules applied as a result of light pen selections, the user generates only syntactically correct commands to the system. He does not have to learn or remember the grammar. The program restricts the user severely in the particular language he can use, but the method for communicating with the program makes these restrictions seem quite natural and unconstraining.  The program has been used successfully for over ten months. ",cacm

The method used is a slight modification of the earlier one - readers were asked to record on a slip provided the details of the book or periodical they were looking for, or subject area they were looking in, their academic status, and the date, and then to place the slip in an adjoining box.. Fron analysis of these 'failure' slips it was possible to determine the cause of the reader's failure, the individual book the reader was looking for, and the pattern of failure for different groups of volumes..  A new development was surveys of samples of readers, carried out during the fortnight of peak demand.. Answers to these surveys provided information on the effect or failure on a reader's work, what action he took after failing, whether he found adequate substitutes, how many books he found by browsing, and what proportion of the books he consulted he borrowed.. Some of these answers could be checked by a direct count of the books used in, and borrowed from, the library..   The investigations were carried out in three University libraries, each with its own characteristic library structure and teaching patterns.. These differences were reflected in the results obtained..   It is hoped that the methods of investigation used can be employed by librarians to investigate the effectiveness of some of the services in their own libraries.. ",cisi

An attempt to make retrospective searching economically feasible has led to formulation of different search techniques..

1997,"A Fast Method for Solving a Class of Tridiagonal Linear Systems The solution of linear systems having real, symmetric, diagonally dominant,tridiagonal coefficient matrices with constant diagonals is considered. It is proved that the diagonals of the LU decomposition converges when floating-point precision. It is also proved that the computed LU decomposition converges when floating-point arithmetic is used and that the limits of the LU diagonals using floating point are roughly within machine precision of the limits using real arithmetic. This fact is exploited to reduce the number of floating-point operations required to solve a linear system from 8n-7 to 5n+2k-3, where k is much less than n, the order of the matrix. If the elements of the subdiagonals and superdiagonals are 1, then only 4n+2k-3 operations are needed. The entire LU decomposition takes k words of storage, and considerable savings in array subscripting are achieved.  Upper and lower bounds on k are obtained in terms of the ratio of the coefficient matrix diagonal constants and parameters of the floating-point number system. Various generalizations of these results are discussed. ",cacm

This ideal he set out in a chapter entitled ""Tasks for the future."" There was a time, and not so very far back, when the library administrator and the cataloger worked side by side.

Many new problems of administration have served to busy the administrator, and most catalogers have had more work than enough, with the result that administrators have come to know less and less of cataloging, and catalogers have come to know less and less about general library administration. The situation now is that the administrator will be forced to pay more attention to cataloging because it has become a major problem field. ",cisi

3124,"A Case Study in Programming for Parallel-Processors An affirmative partial answer is provided to the question of whether it is possible to program parallel-processor computing systems to efficiently decrease execution time for useful problems. Parallel-processor systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of the processors can simultaneously execute separate tasks of a single job, thus cooperating to decrease the solution time of a computational problem. The processors have independent instruction counters, meaning that each processor executes its own task program relatively independently of the other processors. Communication between cooperating processors is by means of data in storage shared by all processors. A program for the determination of the distribution of current in an electrical network was written for a parallel-processor computing system, and execution of this program was simulated. The data gathered from simulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution of this problem, typical of a large class of important problems. It is shown that, with proper programming, solution time when N processors are applied approaches 1/N times the solution time for a single processor, while improper programming can actually lead to an increase of solution time with the number of processors.  Stability of the method of solution was also investigated. ",cacm

(2) qualitative and quantitative changes which occur in the protein of normal lenses with advancing age show a character similar to those in senile cataract, however, they are less pronounced. in this instance, the de- crease in the quantity of soluble protein is likewise closely associated with the diminution of the protein content in the slow fractions of the electropherogram. (3) the changes in the soluble protein content of the lens and the alterations of the protein amounts in the slow fractions which always accompany the former, play the principal role in the aging process of the lens and in the development of senile cataract. (4) the investigations seem to indicate that the aging processes, of lenses as well as the development of senile cataract are of a similar character, but of different intensity. (5) undoubtedly, the processes of transition from slow fractions of soluble protein into faster ones and the transformation of part of the soluble protein into insoluble protein which is likely to be associated with these processes as well as the partial disappearance of total protein from the lens seem to play a very important part in the mechanisms pertaining to the development of cataract.

4387,"Current Awareness Searches on CT, CBAS and ASCA  During the past year we have been one of the organizations participating in the Chemical Society's experiment on the use of routine computer searches of Chemical Titles (CT) and Chemical- Biological Activities (CBAC) for current awareness. For some time we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject Citation Alert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for Scientific Information as a by-product of the Science Citation Index. These three sources differ in their scope and methods, but share the same ultimate objective of providing a computer-based current awareness service.  CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides only authors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved. CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with biological systems, but provides abstracts which are available for computer search. The computer can also search for molecular formulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of all compounds included in the abstracts. ASCA in its original form was based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of references to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers citing this work. Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', which is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore analogous to a CT search.  This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so far with these three services, and the potential use of systems of this type. ",cisi

This was a subject which it was possible to write on or to discuss at great length, advancing a number of theoretical arguments or opinions expressed by pundits, without ever stating a single demonstratable fact. When, in the early 1950's, various people, such as Taube and Mooers, proposed new techniques for indexing, the reaction from the traditionally-minded was such that it appeared there was to be a repetition of all the old arguments. In an editorial in American Documentation in 1955, Perry expressed a viewpoint, shared by many others, when he wrote:    Cautious and searching evaluation of all experimental results is   essential in rating the efficiency of documentation systems. May   the age-old controversies that arose from the conventional concepts   of classification not be reborn in the mechanized searching systems   of the future. There is hope for the avoidance of such errors if   we will but regard documentation systems as useful devices, the   benefits of which must be determined, not by polemics, but by the   intelligent measurement of such benefits in relation to needs and   costs. The machines of the future can make us free, but only if we   are willing to subject them, and ourselves, to the most rigid   intellectual discipline. ",cisi

4124,"PRECIS: a manual of concept analysis and subject indexing  In 1951, the British Bibliography introduced the relatively new technique of chain indexing to British libraries. Twenty years later, with chain procedure established as one of the standard techniques, BNB again pioneered a new approach to subject indexing when it adopted PRECIS from its first issues of 1971.  To explain why this change was felt to be necessary, we have to consider these indexing systems in the light of the new approaches to handling bibliographic data which have developed over the past decade of so. Two forces, in particular, have affected both descriptive cataloguing and subject indexing during this period; firstly, the introduction of computers; secondly, and concomitantly, the development of bibliographic data exchange networks, of which MARC is, perhaps, the primary example.  In some respects, PRECIS represents a parallel development in the field of subject indexing. Traditionally, indexing systems have also tended to be dominated by the concept of a most significant term which, once identified by the indexer, would be offered as the user's access point to the alphabetical file. This applied most obviously to subject heading systems. A good deal of Cutter's ""Rules for a dictionary catalog"" is devoted to the problem of identifying this most significant term in a compound heading and presenting it as the user's access point, even when this entailed a distortion of natural language, and the production of inverted headings. The unselected component would then be lost as an entry word, unless the indexer also created a further heading or headings, in which case none of these headings would be co-extensive with the subject of the document.

The threats are cyclical and are associated with the local tax picture, which at the present time is notably obscure. The abortive attempts earlier this year to reduce appropriations for the libraries in Newark and New York received widespread attention both because the libraries are quite visible nationally and because the proposed cuts were preposterously unmistakable. In the eye of the politician who must find that tiny bit of safe water between the shoals of economy and those of service, the library appears to be expendable ballast to be dumped in heavy weather. In 12 years in two city libraries, I have seen almost every budget year produce a critical fight to prevent disaster from overtaking the library. I think the experience is not uncommon.

An alternative generator proposed by Tausworthe, which uses irreducible polynomials over the field of characteristic two, is shown to be free from this defect. The applicability of these two generators to the IBM 360 is then discussed.

1766,"Optimizing Decision Trees Through Heuristically Guided Search Optimal decision table conversion has been tackled in the literature using two approaches, dynamic programming and branch-and-bound. The former technique is quite effective, but its time and space requirements are independent of how ""easy"" the given table is. Furthermore, it cannot be used to produce good, quasi optimal solutions. The branch-and-bound technique uses a good heuristic to direct the search, but is cluttered up by an enormous search space, since the number of solutions increases with the number of test variables according to a double exponential. In this paper we suggest a heuristically guided top-down search algorithm which, like dynamic programming, recognizes identical subproblems but which can be used to find both optimal and quasi optimal solutions. The heuristic search method introduced in this paper combines the positive aspects of the above two techniques. Compressed tables with a large number of variables can be handled without deriving expanded tables first. ",cacm

Reality and knowledge are not represented by words or terms but by the meanings ""behind"" these tokens. A concept of, say, an object, a property of an object, a process, etc. is derived from verbal statements on these as subjects and may therefore be defined as the whole of true and possible predicates that can be collected on a given subject. It is from these predicates that the characteristics of the corresponding concepts can be derived. Common characteristics in different concepts lead to relations between concepts, which relations in turn are factors for the formation of concept systems. Different kinds of relationships as well as different kinds of concepts are distinguished. It is pointed out that an orderly supply of the elements for propositions (information statements) on new knowledge requires the construction and availability of such concept systems. ",cisi

1651,"Automatic Derivation of Microsentences The decomposition of long complex English sentences into shorter kernel-like constituent sentences (microsentences)has often been suggested as an avenue toward conducting automatic retrieval of natural language messages. To explore the prospects of such a step, the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare a general program for deriving microsentences from longer sentences that had been syntactically analyzed by the Harvard Multipath Analysis Program. The basic idea was to extract the subject, verb and object (if any) of each clause and to reassemble these materials into a grammatical microsentence. A program is described in this paper, which was designed to operate on the tree structure output of the analyzer, and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited.  The authors conclude that while microsentences of the quality achieved do not open up immediate prospects for improving the performance of automatic message retrieval systems, they may have practical value in man-machine systems using human monitors to select the preferred syntactic interpretation of a sentence.

5438,"experimental investigation of the effect of yaw on rates of heat transfer to transverse circular cylinders in a 6500-foot-per-second hypersonic air stream . experimental investigation of the effect of yaw on rates of heat transfer to transverse circular cylinders in a 6500-foot-per-second hypersonic air stream . a technique has been developed by which air can be shock-compressed by helium to 3660 degrees rankine to generate a 6500-foot-per-second air stream with a flow duration of 40 milliseconds . the resulting equipment is described . experiments were conducted to determine rates of heat transfer to transverse circular cylinders of 0.003-, greater than 100 . the cylinders were tested at a nominal mach number of 11 with a stagnation reynolds number (evaluated with free-stream mass flow and stagnation viscosity of 4.00 times 10 to the 4th power per foot .

4917,"free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic stability and drag of a 10 blunted cone at mach numbers 3 .5 and 8 .5 . free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic stability and drag of a 10 blunted cone at mach numbers 3. 5 and 8 .5 . tests were made of a short blunt-nosed without a 50 half-angle conical afterbody in a pressurized ballistic range at nominal mach numbers of 3.5 and of 90,000 and 220,000, respectively . it was found that the models were statically stable about the center- of-gravity location tested but exhibited neutral dynamic stability for flight at constant altitude . the static stability was not affected by the but was nonlinear with angle of attack and varied with mach number . the nonlinear variation of the pitching moment with angle of attack was accurately approximated by a cubic polynomial . the static stability was only qualitatively predicted by modified newtonian theory . the drag characteristics were in good agreement with values calculated by use of modified newtonian theory .  calculations of the oscillatory behavior of the configurations flying an example entry trajectory through the martian atmosphere indicated the configurations to be dynamically satisfactory . pitching motions should converge to a small fraction of the amplitude at entry, provided the initial angle of attack and pitch rate are not large enough to cause tumbling .
