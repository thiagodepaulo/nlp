2527,"Anomalous Behavior of the Fifty-Percent Rule in Dynamic Memory Allocation This paper reports simulation data showing that, in dynamic memory allocation, the average free-to-allocated-block ratio can differ considerably and in both directions from the predictions of the 50 percent rule. A new derivation is given, and it is shown that previous derivations make an assumption that may be violated frequently. On the basis of the simulation data and the derivation, it is hypothesized that the anomalous behavior results from the combined effects of systematic placement and the statistics of the release process. Additional simulations support this hypothesis. Systematic placement, which refers to the natural convention of always allocating storage requests against the same end of the free block selected by the allocation strategy, tends to order blocks within contiguous groups according to their allocation time. The degree of anomalous behavior depends on the extent to which allocated blocks are released in the order of their allocation. For non-Markovian release processes, the extent of the correlation between allocation order and release order varies approximately inversely with the coefficient of variation of the memory residence time distribution.  The simulations show that allocation efficiency depends strongly on the residence time distribution; efficiency decreases as the distribution's coefficient of variation increases. Some practical implications are briefly discussed. ",cacm
6391,"transient familial neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. a syndrome of transient familial neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to known causes has been described in 24 infants of 8 unrelated, healthy caucasian mothers. four of the infants developed kernicterus. beginning in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, sera from the 8 mothers and their newborn infants inhibited direct-reacting bilirubin and o-aminophenol glucuronide formation by rat liver slices and homogenates, respectively, 4 to 10 times more than was observed with sera from a control group of pregnant women and their infants. the serum inhibitory factor in these women is unidentified. the fact that the inhibitor occurs in pregnancy serum suggests that it is probably a progestational steroid that inhibits glucuronyl transferase activity in the liver of neonates. the mechanism responsible for increased serum inhibitor factor activity in these women is unknown and requires further study.

174,"AUTOMAST: Automatic Mathematical Analysis and Symbolic Translation A procedure for numerically solving systems of ordinary differential equation is shown to also generate symbolic solutions. The procedure is based on a finite Taylor series expansion that includes an estimate of the error in the final result. A computer program is described that reads in a system of such equations and then generates the expansions for all of the dependent variables. The expansions are determined symbolically, hence any non-numeric parameters in the original equations are carried automatically into the final expansions. Thus the exact influence of any parameters on the problem solution can be easily displayed. ",cacm

However, they may remember a surprising amount of such ""nonstandard"" information as the color of the document's cover or its approximate length.. Could this type of ""nonstandard"" information be profitably exploited in computerized catalogs of the future? Such facilities, if available, would surely be used, for according to catalog usage surveys a majority of today's library patrons seek known documents, and of these, a substantial minority possess nonstandard information.. In this report, the results of a memory experiment to test the memorability of various types of nonstandard information are described and analyzed.. A ranking according to relative memorability and potential retrieval usefulness of various nonstandard book features is given.. It is estimated that if the average patron's nonstandard information were exploited by appropriate retrieval strategies, he would only have to search through roughly one five-hundredth as many documents as in a random search.. This reduction factor is great enough to make nonstandard information potentially useful in many situations.. ",cisi

415,"On Accurate Floating-Point Summation The accumulation of floating-point sums is considered on a computer which performs t-digit base B floating-point addition with exponents in the range -m to M. An algorithm is given for accurately summing N t-digit floating-point numbers. Each of these N numbers is split into q parts, forming qN t-digit floating-point numbers. Each of these is then added to the appropriate one of n auxiliary t-digit accumulators. Finally, the accumulators are added together to yield the computed sum. In all, qN+n-1 t-digit floating-point additions are performed. Under usual conditions, the relative error in the computed sum is at most [(t+1)/v]B^(1-t) for some v. Further, with an additional q+n-1 t-digit additions, the computed sum can be corrected to full t-digit accuracy.  For example, for the IBM/360 (B=16, t=14, M=63, m=64), typical values for q and n are q=2 and n=32. In this case, (*) becomes N <= 32,768, and we have [(t+1)/v]B^(1-t) = 4x16^-13. ",cacm

3726,"Patterns of Intellectual Influence in Scientific Research   A widespread conception of the development of science holds that the great discoveries are a result of the cumulative work of a vast number of scientists.. Those historians and philosophers of science who express this point of view see the scientist who produces pedestrian research as an integral part of the developmental process.. The great men of science stand atop a pyramid of less distinguished and, to a large extent, invisible scientists.. An alternative hypothesis holds that relatively few scientists are responsible for advance in science and that, in the broader historical perspective, most of the eminent scientists, even of the calibre of Nobel laureates and National Academy members of today, are the ""pedestrians"" of history..   This paper attempts to put these conflicting ideas to empirical test for the field of physics.. Three independent sets of data are analyzed: one is drawn from a stratified random sample of American academic physicists, a second from a subjective evaluation of significant contributions to recent physics, a third from a set of papers cited in The Physical Review.. All three sets of data indicate that there is a sharp stratification in the use of work published by various types of scientists.. The data support the hypothesis that the physicists who produce important discoveries depend almost wholly on the research produced by a relatively small number of scientists.. The implications of these findings for the social structure of science are discussed and areas for necessary future research are suggested.. ",cisi

1613,"Buffer Allocation in Merge-Sorting A fixed buffer allocation for merge-sorting is presented here which minimizes the number of input-output operations for a given order of merge.  When sorting on movable arm disks, the number of seeks is equal to the number of input-output operations, and the seek time usually controls the sort time. First some standard terminology is introduced. Then the input buffer allocation method is described, followed by an analysis of the improvement to be expected over more conventional allocation. This analysis makes use of a particular distribution function. An analysis of a completely different distribution is given which yields similar results. This suggests that the results do not depend on a particular distribution function. An optimum output buffer size is also determined. It is concluded that this buffering allocation can significantly reduce the time of merge sorting on movable arm disks when the input data are not random, and that this output buffer allocation should be used whether the data is random or not.

It has been generalized and adapted to fit into the complete timetabling process; to use a more compact data representation and more efficient processing techniques; to take fuller advantage of possible available previous knowledge about the matrix. And it is designed as a structured program, which can readily be coded by the reader in the high level or low level programming language of his choice. Practical tests of the method have shown it to be a good basis for a realistic timetabling algorithm. ",cacm

There can be no quarrel about the practical necessity for such a labor-saving, worry-reducing work, nor--abstractly--about its value as a global standardizing agent, a means for achieving some uniformity in an area that would otherwise be chaotic. Undoubtedly, it is a real boon to scholars, as well as to ordinary readers, to find familiar, fairly constant headings in subject catalogs as far removed geographically as Washington, DC and Lusaka, Zambia. Knowledge and scholarship are, after all, universal. And a subject-scheme should, ideally, manage to encompass all the facets of what has been printed and subsequently collected in libraries to the satisfaction of the worldwide reading community. Should, that is. But in the realm of headings that deal with people and cultures--in short, with humanity--the LC list can only ""satisfy"" parochial, jingoistic Europeans and North Americans, white-hued, at least nominally Christian (and preferably Protestant) in faith, comfortably situated in the middle and higher-income brackets, largely domiciled in suburbia, fundamentally loyal to the Established Order, and heavily imbued with the transcendent, incomparable glory of Western civilization.

596,"Fingers or Fists? (The Choice of Decimal or Binary Representation) The binary number system offers many advantages over a decimal representation for a high-performance, general-purpose computer. The greater simplicity of a binary arithmetic unit and the greater compactness of binary numbers both contribute directly to arithmetic speed. Less obvious and perhaps more important is the way binary addressing and instruction formats can increase the overall performance. Binary addresses are also essential to certain powerful operations which are not practical with decimal instruction formats.  On the other hand, decimal numbers are essential for communicating between man and the computer. In applications requiring the processing of a large volume of inherently decimal input and output data, the time for decimal-binary conversion needed by a purely binary computer may be significant. A slower decimal adder may take less time than a fast binary adder doing an addition and two conversions.

Somehow, whatever their pedagogic utility and their abstract plausibility, those notions did not at all fit the enterprise that historical study displayed. Yet they were and are fundamental to many discussions of science, and their failures of verisimilitude therefore seemed thoroughly worth pursuing. The result was a drastic shift in my career plans, a shift from physics to history of science and then, gradually, from relatively straightforward historical problems back to the more philosophical concerns that had initially led me to history. Except for a few articles, this essay is the first of my published works in which these early concerns are dominant. In some part it is an attempt to explain to myself and to friends how I happened to be drawn from science to its history in the first place. ",cisi
4704,"the influence of two-dimensional stream shear on airfoil maximum lift . the influence of two-dimensional stream shear on airfoil maximum lift . the cornell aeronautical laboratory is conducting a program of theoretical and experimental research on low-speed aerodynamics as applied to stol and vtol aircraft . the objective of this program is to re-examine certain aspects of classical aerodynamic information, in the light of low-speed flight requirements, with the aim of seeking aerodynamic processes which might be exploited to enhance law-speed performance . one aspect of propeller-driven aircraft which has recently received increasing attention is the existence of strong gradients of longitudinal velocity, or shear, in the propeller slipstream . this slipstream shear interacts with a wing surface and can alter the wing characteristics . in theoretical treatments of a wing interacting with a propeller slipstream, the first important simplification is the replacement of the slipstream with an ideal uniform jet, free of all velocity gradients . the application of these theories requires that one equate the actual slipstream to an effective uniform jet . one method employed is to assume the uniform jet has a momentum flux equal to the average in the propeller slipstream . these and similar procedures are well founded on momentum considerations., however, the implicit assumption is that the flow nonuniformity, the shear, does not influence the wing characteristics .

The broader concept, foreign aid or foreign assistance, means providing another country with any kind of goods, whether financial, commodity, or manpower, to almost any purpose, and extends to antiquity. Technical assistance, which may be defined, on the other hand, as the supplying of techniques, is an outgrowth of the industrial revolution and parallels America's rise in the nineteenth century to world recognition as an important industrial and trade power. Government use of such aid as an instrument of foreign policy, as well as the integration of these private and public efforts in the foreign assistance field, began to develop under President Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy.

This problem can be represented as a shortest path problem on a graph and can be solved using well-known graph search algorithms.  The relations between this representation of the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach are discussed, showing that the graph search method can lead to substantial improvements in computing time. Moreover, if heuristic search methods are used, the computing time will depend on the amount of noise in the picture. Some experimental results are given; these show how various information about the shape of the contour of an object can be embedded in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction of contours from noisy picture and the separation of touching objects.

92,"The Conversion of Limited-Entry Decision Tables to Optimal and Near-Optimal Flowcharts: Two New Algorithms Two new algorithms for deriving optimal and near-optimal flowcharts from limited entry decision tables are presented. Both take into account rule frequencies and the time needed to test conditions.  One of the algorithms, called the optimum-finding algorithm, leads to a flowchart which truly minimizes execution time for a decision table in which simple rules are already contracted to complex rules. The other one, called the optimum-approaching algorithm, requires many fewer calculations but does not necessarily produce the optimum flowchart. The algorithms are first derived for treating decision tables not containing an ELSE-rule, but the optimum-approaching algorithm is shown to be equally valid for tables including such a rule. Both algorithms are compared with existing ones and are applied to a somewhat large decision table derived from a real case. From this comparison two conclusions are drawn. (1) The optimum-approaching algorithm will usually lead to better results than comparable existing ones and will not require more, but usually less, computation time.(2) In general, the greater computation effort needed for applying the optimum-finding algorithm will not be justified by the small reduction in execution time obtained.

It is argued that these are not justified in many (if not most) cases and hence lead to major deficiencies in the resulting systems. These assumptions are: (1) the critical deficiency under which most managers operate is the lack of relevant information, (2) the manager needs the information he wants, (3) if a manager has the information he needs his decision making will improve, (4) better communication between managers improves organizational performance, and (5) a manager does not have to understand how his information system works, only how to use it. To overcome these assumptions and the deficiencies which result from them, a management information system should be imbedded in a management control system. A procedure for designing such a system is proposed and an example is given of the type of control system which it produces. ",cisi

6925,"stimulus overload, action cycles, and the completion gradient systematic inquiries into the origin of certain emotional disturbances of infants show that consistent maternal care is vital for the child's normal physical, psychic, and social development, indeed, for his survival. the most elementary precondition for consistent maternal care is the physical presence of the mother or her substitute. it has, however, become increasingly apparent that children's development can also be stunted, and that they suffer damage of varying extent by the attention of, and close contact with, a mother who dispenses what seems to be the ""wrong kind of mothering"". a model of the mother-baby interaction is proposed to explicate the dynamics of the ""wrong kind of mothering"" and its consequences: my proposition is that the mutual exchanges between mother and baby consist in a give and take of action and reaction between the two partners, which requires from each of them both active and passive responses. these responses form series and chains, the single links of which consist in what i call ""action cycles,"" each completed in itself and at the same time anticipating the next link. i designated these seriated response exchanges as the ""precursor of dialogue,"" as a primal dialogue. the dialogue acts as a vector of the baby's development, influencing its direction and stimulating it to adaptive efforts and psychic growth. it follows that inappropriate mothering (quantitatively as well as qualitatively) results in what is referred to at this time as the ""derailment"" of the primal dialogue. controlled experiments with animals, findings of experimental psychology, and, lastly, clinical findings illustrate the mechanics of the derailed dialogue and its sequelae. in the cases under review a surfeit of stimulation, a psychic overloading, resulted in the derailment of dialogue. overloading prevents its subject from completing actions or responses initiated by him. long-lasting overload results in the cumulation of ""incompleted action cycles"". the sequelae of this cumulation are profound changes in the behavior of the individual. these changes are manifested in a departure from the norms of individual and social behavior patterns that are maladaptive for the individual and asyntonic with his society, that is, asocial. the derailment of the dialogue is triggered, perhaps even caused, by the nature of the social setting. one setting, over-population, is extensively discussed in connection with an animal experiment, and the implications for the human community are examined.

716,"Using Synthetic Images to Register Real Images with Surface Models A number of image analysis tasks can benefit from registration of the image with a model of the surface being imaged. Automatic navigation using visible light or radar images requires exact alignment of such images with digital terrain models. In addition, automatic classification of terrain, using satellite imagery, requires such alignment to deal correctly with the effects of varying sun angle and surface slope. Even inspection techniques for certain industrial parts may be improved by this means. We achieve the required alignment by matching the real image with a synthetic image obtained from a surface model and known positions of the light sources. The synthetic image intensity is calculated using the reflectance map, a convenient way of describing surface reflection as a function of surface gradient.  We illustrate the technique using LANDSAT images and digital terrain models. ",cacm

This implies recognition of the relations between the classes, and the whole operation is often referred to neatly as 'locating and relating'. Assuming that we examine only a limited set of documents (those most likely to be relevant) the operation is entirely one of classification - the recognition of particular classes and their relations.

The unique feature of these codes is that they can accept conventionally recorded qualitative as well as quantitative test results.  Consequently, clinical test results need not be arbitrarily stratified, standardized, or altered in any way to be coded.

3802,"Informal Channels of Communication In the Behavioral Sciences: Their Relevance In the Structuring of Formal or Bibliographic Communication   What are the needs being served by informal communication? What can be done about giving informal communication, without destroying its function for the active researcher, certain of the advantages of formal communication, such as, general accessibility, permanence, etc.? How can formal channels be manipulated to take on the characteristics of informal communication? To cast light on these questions the present paper examines the role of informal and formal channels within the overall system of scientific dissemination in psychology, considers the special advantages of informal communication, and outlines certain relations between informal and formal channels. In a final section of the paper, two experiments in scientific communication are described; one experiment being built about an innovation that attempts to ""informalize"" formal channels while the other is built about another innovation that, in general, attempts to ""formalize"" an informal channel.

1008,"Further Remarks on Line Segment Curve-Fitting Using Dynamic Programming In a recent paper, Bellman showed how dynamic programming could be used to determine the solution to a problem previously considered by Stone. The problem comprises the determination, given N, of the N points of subdivision of a given interval (a,B) and the corresponding line segments, that give the best least squares fit to a function g(x) in the interval.  Bellman confined himself primarily to the analytical derivation, suggesting briefly, however, how the solution of the equation derived for each particular point of subdivision u(i) could be reduced to a discrete search. In this paper, the computational procedure is considered more fully, and the similarities to some of Stone's equations are indicated.  It is further shown that an equation for u(i) involving no minimization may be found. In addition, it is shown how Bellman's method may be applied to the curve-fitting problem when the additional constraints are added that the ends of the line segments must be on the curve. ",cacm

3416,"Library Optimum Sir,-In his recent article B.C. Brookes propounds an ingenious mathematical framework to determine which periodical volumes a library should hold. He is careful to point out that the selection will need regular review and revision, in case the value of the aging factor a or the contents of the Bradford set change from year to year. There is as yet very little experimental evidence on the consistency of either. Such limited evidence as there is suggests that the aging factor is reasonably constant. But the position of the Bradfod set is less satisfactory. The Nature Conservancy librarians (J. M. Weingott and S. M. Penny, unpublished) have lent me a list of titles cited in the Journal of Ecology three or more times in 1955-56, and a similar list for 1965-66. There are 150 periodical titles in the two lists, but only forty-two (28%) appear in both. Of the thirty-three titles cited nine or more times in either year, only eight (25%) attained that level in both, and twelve were cited less than three times in the other year. The Kendall rank correlation coefficient between the two years is 0.18 and not significant.  There is another major practical problem. The article assumes that the data analyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and Bradford sets are valid parameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers. There is no mention of the type of data to use. The reader who sought guidance from the earlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in which analyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed in terms of library use. Krauze and Hillinger have discussed the difference between citations in one article and future citations to that article. Their work implies a more complex relation between a and u than Brookes suggests. In any case, the validity of citations for forecasting library consultations remains unproven, and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is not necessarily close. For example, one item in a list of references is often intended to lead to a chain of earlier papers. Again, each citation represents an author's selection from a wider group most of which he has consulted in a library. In neither case is there any inherent reason for similarity of age distribution or of pool of titles between the list of citations and the items read by the author or his readers. ",cisi

We propose to do both at once and to move each expression directly to the entrance of the outermost loop in which it is invariant. This is done by solving a more general problem, i.e. the elimination of computations performed twice on a given execution path. Such computations are termed partially redundant. Moreover, the algorithm does not require any graphical information or restrictions on the shape of the program graph. Testing this algorithm has shown that its execution cost is nearly linear with the size of the program, and that it leads to a smaller optimizer that requires less execution time. ",cacm

As often happens in programming applications the price of the additional space is computer time.

This definition provides for the existence of a hierarchy of localities at any given time, and the reasonableness of the definition is supported by examples taken from actual programs.

In the input translation grammar, each BNF syntactic rule corresponds to a (possibly empty) ""code generator"" realizable as an assembly language, Fortran or Algol, subroutine that is called whenever that syntactic rule is applied in the parse of a program. Typical one-pass compilers constructed by the PGS translate source programs at speeds approaching 14,000 cards per minute. For an XPL compiler, the parser program and its tables currently occupy 288 words of 60-bit core memory of which 140 words are parsing table entries and 82 words are links to code generators. ",cacm

3412,"Introduction to the ADI Annual Review  Over the past 15 or 20 years, a new and growing field of inquiry has begun to take shape. This field, which will be referred to as ""Information Science and Technology,"" draws on fragments and fringes of a number of sciences, technologies, disciplines, arts, and practices. The element that provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is a shared deep concern with ""information"" - its generation, transformation, communication, storage, retrieval, and use.  Because of the universality of information processes, and also because of the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them, there is very little agreement about the boundaries of Information Science and Technology, or about its parentage, its essential nature, or its future. To put it simply, at the present time there is no clearly defined and well-understood field of Information Science and Technology. There is not, truth to tell, even clear agreement on what the word ""information"" itself means and particularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or a commodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged. Distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they need not and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interest to users, designers, and students of information systems and services. The purpose of the ADI Annual Review series, initiated in this volume, is to provide such a review. ",cisi
4170,"Communication among Scientists and Engineers  Since 1966, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Research in Scientific Communication has been conducting studies of the information flow process - the production, dissemination, and assimilation of information - associated with nine scientific and engineering disciplines. This process in most disciplines appears, from the dissemination point of view, to consume about five years - from the time a scientist begins his research until reports of his findings are cited in a review. To date we have conducted over sixty studies of this process and, since one of the main goals of our program is to make genuine comparisons of the scientific communication associated with the disciplines being studied, we have standardized the procedures, instruments, and analyses in those of the major studies which were conducted for all disciplines.  We will present findings from the major studies conducted to date in order (1) to indicate the types of data we have collected on approximately 30,000 scientists and engineers during the past three years; (2) to indicate some of the goals of our program; and (3) to suggest a preliminary picture of the communication structure of science, as our program has led us to perceive it.

It is, in general, second order except for the case of a linear system with constant coefficients and linear forcing terms; in that case, the method is third order. It has been implemented and put to routine usage in biological applications-where stiffness frequently appears-with favorable results.

3492,"User Evaluation of Information Retrieval Systems  While Fairthorne may not have been the first person to recognize it, certainly, for this author, Fairthorne was the first to make explicit the fundamental problems of information retrieval systems, namely the clash between OBNA and ABNO (Only-But-Not-All and All-But-Not-Only). Although it was not until 1958 that the terms occur in Fairthorne's writings, the concept had been discussed in many meetings of the AGARD Documentation Panel and elsewhere. Originally it was considered that to meet these two requirements, it might be necessary to have two separate systems, and the test of the UNITERM system in 1954 was based on the hypothesis that a 'Marshalling' system (e.g. U.D.C.) was fundamentally different from a 'Retrieval' system (e.g. UNITERM). While the idea persisted in this form for some time, it gradually evolved into the inverse relationship of recall and precision, which is to say that while it is possible to obtain, of the relevant documents, All-But-Not-Only, or alternatively to obtain Only-But- Not-All, it is not possible to obtain All and Only.

4454,"The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology  The criticism and transformation of society can be divorced only at our peril from the criticism and transformation of theories about society. Yet the gap between theory and practice, so common in the history of American radical movements, is in some quarters growing wider. Some of the most militant of American radicals, in the New Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at least temporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory.  This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins. In some part it is due to the fact that these social movements are still new and their political activism consumes their necessarily limited energies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need time to produce their new theories. Although the neglect of theory is scarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the fact that American radicals are often more American than they know and may prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the intangible outputs of theory. Again, part of their neglect of theoretical problems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals have with the ""hippie"" contingent of their generation, whose more expressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culture dispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile ""hassles"" of intellectual confrontation. There is also a vocal minority who, as has been said, feel personally excluded when they hear an appeal to reason. ",cisi

The relation between the version of the induction rule used and the form of the program constructed is explored in some detail. ",cacm

4507,"Statistical Bibliography in Relation to the Growth of Modern Civilization  The following pages form the concluding portion of four lectures delivered by me in the University of Cambridge as Sandars Reader in Bibliography, 1921.  As the two pairs of lectures appeal to widely different classes of the community, I have decided to print them separately, though the underlying theme is the same, viz. the need for uniformity in book classification as a preliminary to co-operative action in library administration and bibliography.  Book classification is shelf classification, and shelf classification carried to its furthest limits leads necessarily to uniformity in the extension and definition of its classes. Add to this a chronological order of books in their classes and your scheme of classification acquires a new value; for it presents for each period a bibliographical counterpart of the corresponding growth of the activities of the human mind.  My first two lectures dealt with this thesis in its practical application to library work and the compilation of subject bibliographies. Here statistical bibliography is considered in relation to the growth of modern civilization.  Strictly speaking, the province of statistical bibliography ends with the presentation of the figures compiled. Their final interpretation should be left to those possessing the necessary qualifications. I am, therefore, conscious that in attempting to furnish some explanation of the interrelations of the various factors which are associated with the growth of modern civilization, I have outstripped the limits of bibliographical propriety.

A column (or row) is dropped by a formal scaling with the imaginary unit, -1, followed by least squares addition of the column (or row). The elimination process for the procedure is successive ssive application of the Givens transformation in modified (more efficient) form. These ideas are illustrated with an implementation of the revised simplex method. The algorithm is a general purpose one that does not account for any particular structure or sparsity in the equations. Some suggested computational tests for determining signs of various controlling parameters in the revised simplex algorithm are mentioned. A simple means of constructing test cases and some sample computing times are presented. ",cacm
58,"A Mathematical Model for Mechanical part Description The flexibility of a mathematical model takes advantage of the common information requirements of computer-aided engineering drawing, numerical control tape generation, and physical characteristic computation. By judicious control of man-machine communication requirements, improved results over conventional engineering design processes are possible. An English-like input language, tailored for use by draftsmen and designers, will describe the part and specify the output desired. One approach to the mathematical model consists of a group of surface-defining quadric equations, which are created by a system of modular subprogram. Other subprograms will convert the mathematical model into instructions for driving automatic drafting machines and numerical controlled machine tools.  Physical part characteristics, such as center of gravity, can be computed by subprograms and used in dynamic analysis work. The proposed overall system is presented and experiments and demonstrations are discussed. ",cacm
5494,"a nonlinear theory of bending and buckling of thin elastic shallow spherical shells . a nonlinear theory of bending and buckling of thin elastic shallow spherical shells .  a shallow spherical dome subjected to lateral pressure is a structure for which the deformation departs appreciably from the linear theory at relatively small values of the deflection amplitude . it is also one for which the buckling process is characterized by a rapid decrease in the equilibrium load once the buckling load has been surpassed . for structures having this type of buckling characteristics the question arises as to whether the proper buckling criterion to apply is the classical criterion, which considers equilibrium with respect to infinitesimal displacements, or the finite-displacement /energy criterion/ proposed by tsien .  in this paper the problem of the finite displacement and buckling of a shallow spherical dome is investigated both theoretically and experimentally . in the theoretical approach the nonlinear equations are converted into a sequence of linear equations by expanding all of the variables in powers of the center deflection and then equating the coefficients of equal powers . the basic parameter for the shallow dome is proportional to the ratio of the central height of the dome h to its thickness t . for small values of this ratio the expansions converge rapidly and enough terms are computed to determine the buckling load according to the classical criterion . for higher values of h t, convergence deteriorates rapidly and it was not possible to determine the buckling load with the number of terms which were computed . however even for these higher values of h t the deflection shapes are determined for deflection amplitudes below the amplitude at which buckling occurs . these deflection shapes are characterized by their rapid change as h t increases and by the fact that, over most of the range of h t studied, the maximum deflection does not occur at the center of the dome .  experimental results seem to indicate that the classical criterion of buckling is applicable to very shallow spherical domes for which the theoretical calculation was made . a transition to energy criterion for higher domes is also indicated .

This study investigates the use of an unconventional method of treating overflow records. The method is to use hashing techniques to allocate space for such records.  If certain conditions are satisfied, this is superior to the conventional ISAM method of chaining the overflow records via linked list techniques. These conditions are: long overflow chains with significant overflow; lack of tight disk space constraints; record keys which are small compared to the total record size; and significant use of the file in the index as opposed to the sequential mode. Using hashed overflow, the time to locate a record is dependent not on the total volume of overflow records as in conventional ISAM, but on the percentage use of space dedicated to overflow records.

Findings show that thesauri viewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cybernetic process of communication (""both-way"" communication).. The survey indicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largely done by indexers alone.. No attempt was made to develop a theory of thesaurus construction and updating..

3021,"Relaxation Methods for Image Reconstruction The problem of recovering an image (a function of two variables) from experimentally available integrals of its grayness over thin strips is of great importance in a large number of scientific areas.  An important version of the problem in medicine is that of obtaining the exact density distribution within the human body from X-ray projections.One approach that has been taken to solve this problem consists of translating the available information into a system of linear inequalities. The size and the sparsity of the resulting system (typically, 25,000 inequalities with fewer than 1 percent of the coefficients nonzero) makes methods using successive relaxations computationally attractive, as compared to other ways of solving systems of inequalities. In this paper, it is shown that, for a consistent system of linear inequalities, any sequence of relaxarion parameters lying strictly between 0 and 2 generates a sequence of vectors which converges to a solution.  Under the same assumptions, for a system of linear equations, the relaxation method converges to the minimum norm solution. Previously proposed techniques are shown to be special cases of our procedure with different choices of relaxation parameters. The practical consequences for image reconstruction of the choice of the relaxation parameters are discussed. ",cacm

3206,"Choosing Physiology Journals  For many years administrators of library collections have sought objective criteria for assembling well-rounded periodical collections in the subject fields represented by their collections. The nearest approach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledge of the specialist was first suggested by Gross and Gross in 1927. This method consists, essentially, of counting the bibliographic citations at the conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field under consideration, and of arranging the journals cited in order of the frequency of their citation. Thus, in the field of chemistry, the references in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are counted and a list is made of the most frequently cited journals. According to Gross and Gross, the journals which are cited most frequently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are the most valuable journals for a library to purchase in order to possess a well-rounded collection in chemistry.  Although the Gross and Gross method has been in use for almost twenty years, the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based have never been examined. These assumptions are: 1. The value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct   proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional   literature. 2. The journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are   representative of the entire field. 3. If more than one journal is used as a base, all of them can be weighted   equally. ",cisi

4649,"The Environment of Classification: The Concept of Mutual Exclusivity   It has been suggested that information science is still of the stage of alchemy: if this is so then mutual exclusivity must form its philosopher's stone.. Mutual exclusivity appears to be alien to the observable universe: that this is so is displayed through a series of examples.. Some of these relate to everyday things like trees, beaches and man himself, whilst others relate to more obscure phenomena like continental drift and black holes.. The act of observation is also considered as this has a considerable bearing on the problem..   Nevertheless, mutual exclusivity must form part of man's mental powers and this has found expression in the relatively exclusive series of symbols used in communication.. The dangers of exclusive thinking in relation to environmental problems are considered, and this results in a paradox which is probably unresolvable.. Finally, it is observed that out-standing genius appears to pay scant regard to existing classifications and is more likely to be involved in an integrated approach to problems.. ",cisi

The more critical of these problems involve: degree of automation, flexibility, browsability, storage space, and retrieval time.. A step toward the solution of these problems is presented here along with several demonstrations of feasibility and advantages..   The methodology on which this solution is based is that of a posteriori automatic classification of the document collection.. Feasibility is demonstrated by automatically classifying a file of 50,000 document descriptions.. The advantages of automatic classification are demonstrated by establishing methods for measuring the quality of classification systems and applying these measures to a number of different classification strategies.. By indexing the 50,000 documents by two independent methods, one manual and one automatic, it is shown that these advantages are not dependent upon the indexing method used..   It was found that among those automatic classification algorithms studied, one particular algorithm, CLASFY, consistently outperformed the others.. In addition, it was found that this algorithm produced classifications at least as good, with respect to the measured established in this dissertation, as the a priori, manual classification system currently in use with the aforementioned file..   The actual classification schedules produced by CLASFY in classifying a file of almost 50,000 document descriptions into 265 categories are included as an appendix to this dissertation.. ",cisi

1534,"ALGOL 60 Confidential The ALGOL 60 Report,* when first encountered, seems to describe a very complex language which will be difficult to learn. The ""metalinguistic formulae"" admirably serve the purpose of precisely specifying a language, but they are certainly not very readable for a beginner. However, experience has shown that once the report is explained it is in fact easy to learn ALGOL and to write algorithms in it. The language is so general and powerful it can handle an enormous class of problems. It is not hard to learn those parts of ALGOL present in other compiler languages: how to write assignment and go to and for statements, etc. Indeed, a lot of the unnecessary restrictions imposed by other compiling languages have finally been lifted. But ALGOL also allows many unobvious things to be written, as we will see later, and herein lies a problem: ALGOL seems to have become too general.  So many restrictions have been lifted that a lot of technical details crop up which are hard to learn and to use correctly. In this paper some of the more obscure features of the language are considered and their usefulness is discussed. Remarks are based on the authors' interpretations of the ALGOL 60 Report. ",cacm

3693,"Education and Training for Scientific and Technological Library and Information Work  The exponential growth of the literature of science and technology is a phenomenon which scientists have been living with for the past 300 years. It is in the nature of such growth that its effect is recognized only slowly, but when a critical point is reached its consequences can be overwhelming. In science information this point has now been reached. To take but one field, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papers to be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first million to be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts. We are now at the stage where one million papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - and before 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equal to the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will be published and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial began publication in 1665. Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science Museum Library was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials. Within only a further 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number. The growth in the use of scientific literature is no less spectacular. Thus, for example, in 1930 the number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000. In 1967 the N.L.L., which had taken over the national lending function of the Science Museum Library, lent well over half-a-million items, a total exceeding that of all the loans by the Science Museum Library between 1929 and 1947 (a period which itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application for peaceful uses, enormous progress in antibiotics, developments in synthetic materials and great advances in all branches of science and technology).

The design language is presented in terms of vocabulary, statements, sequences and microprogram.  Included are examples of identifiers, expressions with both unary and binary operators, declaration statements, transfer statements, terminal statements, exchange statements, if statements, do statements, go to statements, several sequences and a microprogram.

4427,"Social Organization of Hamadryas Baboons  Baboons have adapted to a variety of habitats ranging from West African rain forests to semidesert areas on the coast of the Red Sea. While all baboons are morphologically adapted to life on the ground, some species have become more independent of trees than others. In a rough ecological series, we find on one end the forest dwelling West African Species (Mandrillus leucophaneus, M. sphinx, Papio papio), none of which has so far been studied in the field. The first step into open country is realized by the savanna baboons of South and East Africa, including, from south to north, the species Papio ursinus, cynocephalus and anubis. Their social organization and its ecological context have been subject to long range field work by HALL (1962 a, b) in South Africa, by DEVORE (1962) in Kenya, and by ALTMANN and ALTMANN (in preparation) in Kenya ad Tanzania. In both regions, the groups can range far into the open grassland, but at night, they withdraw to high trees or, as in the Cape region, to vertical cliffs. ",cisi

The book stresses the peculiarity of statistics of language structure as against just conventional statistics. To put the difference between two types of statistics briefly, the latter comprises the methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied, e.g., in Economics and Demography, the former has its own methods and characterising parameters, particularly useful for describing and evaluating language structure. The idea of statistical linguistics as using concepts and methods of its own, which was adumbrated in the author's ""Language as choice and Chance"", 1956, has now taken definite shape.  Of this development I shall try to give a brief account. In my book, ""Language as Choice and Chance"", the foundation was laid for a truly sensible application of statistics to language by my interpretation of the langue-parole dichotomy as being essentially that between statistical universe and sample.

3140,"Space/Time Trade-offs in Hash Coding with Allowable Errors In this paper trade-offs among certain computational factors a given set of messages. Two new hash-coding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency. The new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods. The reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods. In such applications, it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to ""catch"" the small fraction of errors associated with new methods. An example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods. Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time.

4035,"Quantitative Growth of the Mathematical Literature  Since 1868 the number of mathematical publications per year (measured by counts of titles abstracted) has grown from about 800 to 13,000 at an average continuous compound rate of about 2.5 percent per year, doubling about four times a century. Deviations from the exponential curve are clearly related to war, depression, and recovery. If the total number of publications prior to 1868 is estimated by extrapolating from the curve of annual output, the cumulative grand total of mathematical titles grows from 41,000 in 1867 to 419,000 by the end of 1965. Deviations from an exponential growth of 2.5 percent per year are negligible except for two ""pauses"" during world wars, after which the observations continue parallel to the theoretical curve. The well-known hypothesis of exponential growth of the scientific literature is strongly confirmed but at a rate less than half that found by Price and other investigators.	The discrepancy appears to be due to the failure of previous studies to take into account the titles published before the beginnings of the time series used. ",cisi

4153,"The Development of Reference Services through Academic Traditions, Public Library Practice and Special Librarianship  Modern American library history has received only sporadic attention as a subject for investigation. Though we have now accumulated an adequate supply of source materials to draw upon in the form of annual reports, service studies, biographical accounts, and chronicles of individual libraries, no one has yet fashioned out of these materials a critical history of American librarianship. To paraphrase Leo LaMontagne, we have salvaged remnants from the past, but we have yet to convert them into history.  The lack has cost the profession dearly. Even a casual survey of the literature of librarianship reveals the shocking degree of duplication and naivete that stem from an insufficient awareness of previous efforts.  There is clearly room and need for a series of evaluative studies of the development of American library services which could eventually be put together to form the desired definitive history of American librarianship. The present dissertation is intended as a contribution toward that end. It undertakes to furnish the historical background for one of the continuing problems of American librarianship - the provision of reference services in research libraries. ",cisi

Almost anything to do with universities is now headline news. Previously such attention as they did receive was limited to brief reports in sober middle class newspapers of appointments, awards and meetings, leavened once a year by an obligatory account in all newspapers of the Boat Race. All this has changed: as Michael Befoff comments in his book The Plateglass Universities (having made the foregoing points and more besides), what were once ivory towers have now become goldfish bowls.   He goes on to give the obvious explanation for the change: universities are of public interest because they are now almost wholly supported by the taxpayers' money. They represent a massive investment on the part of the government, and consequently are expected to yield a vitally important return in trained and educated manpower. Over the last twenty years government expenditure in this country on universities has risen from four million pounds a year to more than two hundred million pounds a year.

In contrast, sorting in a random access-oriented system encourages the selection of the optimum order of merge from many possible orders. The latter problem is discussed in this paper, along with criteria developed for determining the optimum order of merge according to the various properties of random access storage devices. Attention is also given to the problem of key sorting versus record sorting and the possibly serious disadvantage of key sorting on a random access system. ",cacm

3213,"Algebraic Systems   As far back as the 1920's, algebra had been accepted as the science studying the properties of sets on which there is defined a particular system of operations. However up until the forties the overwhelming majority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic structures. These were primarily groups, rings and lattices. The first general theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary operations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935). During these same years, A. Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic principles of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations. Such sets are now called models. In contrast to algebra, model theory made abundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic. The possibility of making fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but also the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was discovered by the author in 1936.  During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that the theory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately related despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems. And it is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems dealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and relations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is the language of the so-called applied predicate calculus. Thus the theory can be considered to border on logic and algebra. ",cisi

In a nonoriented complete graph with n vertices, Hamitonian circuits equivalent to .5(n - 1)! specific permutations of n elements, termed rosary permutations, can be defined. Each of them corresponds to two circular permutations which mirror-image each other, and is generated successively by a number system covering 3*4*...*(n-1) sets of edges.  Every set of edges {E[k]}, 1 <= E[k] <= k, 3 <= k <= (n-1) is determined recursively by constructing a Hamiltonian circuit with k vertices from a Hamiltonian circuit with k-1 vertices, starting with the Hamiltonian circuit of 3 vertices. The basic operation consists of transposition of a pair of adjacent vertices where the position of the pair in the permutation is determined by {E[k]}.

Both attempts only partially succeed. Konigova proposes three types: formal relevance, subject/content relevance and subjective relevance (or pertinency). This classification has validity, but is not further elaborated, and indeed she reverts to a less precise language; for example, in defining ""second order noise,"" she uses the ambiguous phrase ""a formally relevant document which is not really relevant"" - presumably meaning not subjectively relevant, according to the real need of the enquirer.

They had the choice of adopting one of the good American schemes, which generally make inadequate provision for the needs of overseas Commonwealth libraries; or of adopting one of the English schemes, each of which is virtually tailored to a particular library, and several of which are even less well suited to overseas libraries; or of devising new schemes for themselves.

Four strong determinates of visibility were found: the quality of work, as measured by citations; the honorific awards received for work in physics; the prestige of the physics department to which the scientist belong; and speciality.. Quantity of output, age, and name-ordering patterns on collaborative papers have no independent effect on visibility.. Just as some physicists may be easily seen (i.e., have high visibility), other are in positions where they may easily see..

Since the user is the only person competent to make the final judgement of relevance it is natural to suppose that the selection of items from a data base will lead to two kinds of retrieval error. The extent of these errors is expressed by the familiar measures of performance, precision and recall. Precision measures the failure of the system to retrieve only relevant documents while recall measures its failure to retrieve all relevant documents actually present in the data base. It is difficult to visualize a situation in which a user would find advantage in being provided with irrelevant citations.

2366,"A Modular Computer Sharing System An alternative approach to the design and organization of a general purpose interactive multiterminal computing system is presented. The system organization described is a conceptually simple arrangement of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to process terminal jobs as they arrive. One of the computers serves as the master or control computer and supervises the collection and distribution of messages from and to the remote terminals. In the simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected terminal. A crosspoint switching network allows any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.  Thus, while each active terminal user ""occupies"" a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with many other terminal users in a simple manner.  The ratio of users to computers is dependent on both the size and power of the machines used and the computation requirements of the particular mix of users.  This system organization is inherently a simpler and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers and has the potential of a highly available system at relatively low cost. Economic configurations are possible for a range of systems sizes that span at least one order of magnitude. Finally, problem programs developed by remote terminal users can be run on a dedicated batch system if compatible computers are used. ",cacm

Most current psychology and sociology textbooks do not devote even a short chapter to the subject of formal organizations.

1692,"A Technique for Isolating Differences Between Files A simple algorithm is described for isolating the differences between two files. One application is the comparing of two versions of a source program or other file in order to display all differences.  The algorithm isolates differences in a way that corresponds closely to our intuitive notion of difference, is easy to implement, and is computationally efficient, with time linear in the file length. For most applications the algorithm isolates differences similar to those isolated by the longest common subsequence.  Another application of this algorithm merges files containing independently generated changes into a single file. The algorithm can also be used to generate efficient encodings of a file in the form of the differences between itself and a given ""datum"" file, permitting reconstruction of the original file from the difference and datum files.

In principle, an examination schedule which requires a minimum number of examination periods and satisfies the constraint that no student be required to take two examinations simultaneously can be found in two steps. First, course which may have their examinations scheduled at the same period are grouped together in all possible ways. Then a minimum number of these groups, such that each course is included at least once, are selected.  By removing multiple occurrences of courses and then scheduling each group at a different period a minimal schedule can be obtained. Known algorithms for carrying out these procedures are prohibitively expensive.  Approximations to the ideal procedure outlined above are given which yield nonminimal but feasible schedules with a very small expenditure of time. Results of experiments using these techniques are given. These are encouraging and indicate that further experimentation would be worthwhile. ",cacm

4195,"Inefficiency of the Use of Boolean Functions for Information Retrieval Systems  In this note we attempt to point out why boolean functions are, in general, not applicable in information retrieval systems.  First, we wish to stress that a system, which supposedly is to serve a certain purpose, has to try to optimize some overall performance rather than certain detailed parts of it. This situation is, of course, well known.  Saying that a system should cater to an optimal performance implies that the reward varies with different circumstances. That is, there may always be some customers who will not agree that the system's output is satisfactory. However, these should be relatively few. In the case of an information retrieval system, let us consider one whose function is to furnish a reference list as a reaction to a question.  So, if we have a set of documents S and a set of questions Q, the system has to assign to each question q, an answer A(q) which is a subset of S. Naturally, this answer cannot be chosen arbitrarily; it should reflect a relation between the question and the resulting reference list. Usually one says that the documents in the list are relevant to the question. More precisely stated, we assume that the enquirer expects a certain reference list, namely the one he would have procured had he himself probed the documents in the set. ",cisi

The fundamental notion of stability of an epidemic process is introduced and a stability theorem is derived.. A mechanism, called an information retrieval process, which instigates an epidemic process is defined, certain general properties of the mechanism are established and the means of controlling it are discussed.. Pontryagin's maximum principle is applied to the problem of achieving optimal control of an epidemic process and it is shown that stability of the process is equivalent to stability in the sense of Lyapunov.. This result makes it possible to determine the conditions for stability without knowledge of the solution of the differential equations which represent the process.. ",cisi

There are three important elements in this general construction method; namely, a set of binary relations, an algorithm for constructing subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an element from the given set of objects. The use of different relations and algorithms results in different information structures, as list, tree, ring, etc. Thus the problem of information organization and storage is reduced to that of defining relations and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.

4330,"The Teachable Language Comprehender: A Simulation Program and Theory of Language  The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program designed to be capable of being taught to ""comprehend"" English text. When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory. This memory is a ""semantic network"" representing factual assertions about the world.  The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text. By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory. In this form it can be added into the memory.  Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed. TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided. Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind.  The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future. ",cisi

Advances in Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need. It will present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature, research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types.   Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all librarians who can visualize its potential. Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series. As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts expected. Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope to get there. ""The Machine and Cataloging"" reviews the current status of the machine-produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC. Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as reported in ""Mechanization of Acquisition Processes."" Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future, not the past. One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in ""Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation."" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions.   For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years.   The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception.   Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow.   Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some.   The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world.

The author holds that the system of scientific communications is based on formal processes (founded on scientific and technical literature, including the primary and secondary sources), whereas the informal processes (in which scientists play the leading part and which have no institutionalized and permanent interactive mechanisms) are also very important, but auxiliary.. The specific features of the informal processes and their interaction with the formal processes are analyzed in detail. Recommendations towards efficient use of the positive aspects of informal communications for raising the overall effectiveness of scientific communication system are offered.. ",cisi
2609,"A Fast Algorithm for Copying List Structures An algorithm is presented for copying an arbitrarily linked list structure into a block of contiguous storage locations without destroying the original list. Apart from a fixed number of program variables, no auxiliary storage, such as a stack, is used.  The algorithm needs no mark bits and operates in linear time. It is shown to be significantly faster than Fisher's algorithm, the fastest previous linear-time algorithm for the same problem. Its speed comes mainly from its efficient list-traversal technique, which folds the processing stack into the structure being built, and from its classification of list cells into nine types, which enables processing operations to be optimized for each type.

This paper, the first in a series of reports on an investigation to gather this data, discusses the research methodology and the development of an inventory of the institution program population upon which the survey is based.. An analysis in terms of geographic location, type (educational, research, etc.), administrative control, and primary cognate area of these institutions is presented, and their distribution through the various Regional Medical Library areas is noted.. Preliminary estimates are made, based on questionnaire to the libraries, on the size of the library population, their relationship to reporting programs or institutions, exclusive of the hospital population which is being covered in an independent survey.. A questionnaire to library personnel is underway which will establish, along with the other questionnaires, a basis for exploring the relationships which exist between institutions or programs, libraries and manpower..

1902,"BRAD: The Brookhaven Raster Display A multiconsole computer display system has been designed that provides very rich displays at low unit cost. Each BRAD (Brookhaven Raster Display) console can plot tens of thousands of points, or up to 4000 characters at 30 frames per second. After an initial display system investment of $50,000 each display, with teletype, costs less than $3,000.  The technique employed is that of programmatically generating a binary image of the desired display in a computer. The image is written on a rotating drum memory. Independent read heads continuously display the picture, which is generated by swept horizontal lines. A standard TV monitor serves as the display device.  The technique has two drawbacks. A computer must compute any image to be displayed. Also, the ""pointing"" interaction is more difficult. This is because the pointing function gives only the coordinates of the point on the screen. The inverse of the map generation process is required to calculate the coordinates of the point on the screen. The inverse of the map generation process is required to calculate the coordinates at the selected point in the input space. ",cacm

2618,"Application of Game Tree Searching Techniques to Sequential Pattern Recognition A sequential pattern recognition (SPR) procedure does not test all the features of a pattern at once. Instead, it selects a feature to be tested. After receiving the result of that test, the procedure either classifies the unknown pattern or selects another feature to be tested, etc. Medical diagnosis is an example of SPR. In this paper the authors suggest that SPR be viewed as a one-person game played against nature (chance). Virtually all the powerful techniques developed for searching two-person, strictly competitive game trees can easily be incorporated either directly or by analogy into SPR procedures.  In particular, one can incorporate the ""mini average backing-up procedure"" and the ""gamma procedure,"" which are the analogues of the ""minimax backing-up procedure"" and the ""alpha-beta procedure,"" respectively.  Some computer simulated experiments in character recognition are presented. The results indicate that the approach is promising. ",cacm

1436,"Digital Synthesis of Correlated Stationary Noise In this note we propose a method of generating stationary noise with a prescribed auto-covariance function by digital methods. The need for such a technique often arises in testing the performance of data processing and engineering systems, where inputs corrupted with correlated noise (of a known form) are required. The technique is quite simple and produces strict-sense stationary noise which agrees approximately with R(t), the prescribed auto-covariance function (acf), over an interval [-T(0), T(0)].  The method consists of approximating the spectral density by a periodic process with spectral lines, and then synthesizing the periodic noise with random phases and appropriate amplitudes. In order to simplify discussion of the statistical properties of the noise generated, the technique is first presented in terms of exact harmonic analysis. In practice, discrete harmonic analysis as presented in the third section is used. ",cacm

The research was prompted by the observation, made by a number of writers, that non-specialty words, words which possess little value for indexing purposes, tend to be distributed at random in a collection of documents.. In contrast, specialty words are not so distributed..   In Part I of the study, a mixture of two Poisson distributions is examined in detail as a model of specialty word distribution, and formulas expressing the three parameters of the model in terms of empirical frequency statistics are derived.. The fit of the model is tested on an experimental document collection and found to be acceptable for the purposes of the study..

Totals were maintained for three areas of journal usage according to: 1) the number of times patrons used current issues, 2) the number of times the journal issues were reshelved by library staff, and 3) the number of times that journals were cited in articles by Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) authors. The survey resulted in a 9.6% reduction in journal subscriptions which, in effect, added 7.5% additional shelf space in which to display journals. Further studies of the accumulated data are being made to determine which holdings will be sent to a remote storage area which is under construction. The survey data have been and will continue to be consulted before any journals are converted to microfilm. ",cisi

This usually takes place as the culmination of a series of modifications to the practice of the art, arising out of changes in the social situation in which the profession operates. Skilled workers, sensitive to changing needs, alter or refine their practice so that it develops in tune with the progress of society itself. Descriptive accounts of new or improved methods appear in the literature; and, from time to time, a leading thinker makes a new synthesis by combining these explanations into a system, or theory, which gives a rational account of what is going on, and so prepares the way forward.

For us the question of whether Hamilton or Madison wrote the disputed Federalist papers has served as a laboratory and demonstration problem for developing and comparing statistical methods.

This paper discusses a simulation model of a data retrieval system which has the effect of significantly reducing the cost of experimentation and enabling research never attempted before. The model is designed to estimate the retrieval workload of alternative data retrieval systems. These data retrieval systems can be organized under several database organizations, including inverted list, threaded list, and cellular list organizations and hybrid combinations of these systems. Effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated by using the model to study the effect of database organizations in data retrieval systems. In particular, the impact of query complexity is analyzed.

The work reported here develops an objective, quantitative design procedure and helps give a better understanding of now to configure display systems. This is accomplished by means of a mathematical model of a computer driven graphics system. The parameters of the model are functions of the capabilities of the graphics hardware and of the computational requirements of the graphics application.  The model can be analyzed using numerical queueing analysis or simulation to obtain an average response time prediction. By combining the model with an optimization, the best graphics system configuration, subject to a cost constraint, is found for several applications. The optimum configurations are in turn used to find general display system design guidelines. ",cacm

A graph theoretic algorithm which examines an arbitrary n x n matrix and determines whether or not it can be permuted into tridiagonal form is given. The algorithm requires no arithmetic while the number of comparisons, the number of assignments, and the number of increments are linear in n. This compares very favorably with standard transformation methods.  If the matrix is permutable into tridiagonal form, the algorithm gives the explicit tridiagonal form.

5493,"a method of calculating velocity distribution for turbulent boundary layers in adverse pressure distributions . a method of calculating velocity distribution for turbulent boundary layers in adverse pressure distributions .  a new method of calculating the behavior of turbulent boundary layers in adverse pressure distributions is developed which permits direct determination of the velocity profile rather than the gross integral parameters normally used to infer the general character of the boundary layer . the method offers the simplicity of algebraic equations coupled with the use of charts rather than the laborious simultaneous solution of coupled differential equations required by existing methods . the method also affords, for the first time, a means of determining the total boundary-layer thickness, thus allowing calculation of the absolute as well as the nondimensional velocity distribution . the velocity profile is considered to be composed of two regions--an inner region which is described by the law of the wall and an outer region which is described by a function depicting the deviation from that law . the deviation function involves two parameters which are uniquely dependent upon the skin-friction coefficient and a third parameter which, for practical purposes, can be considered a constant . since the entire velocity distribution was found to be almost uniquely dependent upon the local skin friction, serious doubt is cast upon the generally accepted /history concept/ which considers the outer region of the boundary layer to be dependent on integrated upstream conditions .  agreement between experimental velocity distributions and those calculated by the method presented here is generally very good . the analysis and calculation procedures which are presented are applicable to two-dimensional, pseudo-two- dimensional, and axisymmetric conical flows .

However, when indirect addressing is used, as in SNOBOL, naming constraints may be introduced. Two modifications to SNOBOL are described, resulting in two desirable consequences: (1) naming constraints disappear even when there is indirect addressing within function definitions; and (2) there is a significant saving in the number of calls to the garbage collector, because some garbage is collected, at little expense, each time a function returns to its calling program. These modifications have been implemented as an extension to a SNOBOL dialect. ",cacm

Although this picture is of value to the analyst, the elements of an n-dimensional array must exist in conventional storage as a linear array or vector.  The means of performing the transformation of a set of indices locating on array element in n-space to the location (address) of the element in its storage vector is the subject of this paper. It is noted that the index address transformation is computationally identical to the conversion of a number from a fixed to a mixed radix number system. Several ways of implementing the transformation are described. ",cacm

Burton and Kebler point out that literature becomes obsolescent rather than disintegrating (as in its original meaning), so that 'half-life' means 'half the active life', and this is commonly understood as meaning the time during which one-half of the currently active literature was published. Numerous studies have been carried out, mainly by the analysis of citations, to establish obsolescence rates of the literature of different subjects. Bourne points out that different studies have given widely different results, so that many of the 'half-life' figures reported are not valid beyond the particular sample of literature or users surveyed; certainly they cannot be used as accurate measures for discriminating between different subject-fields.

3449,"Journal Usage Patterns and their Implications in the Planning of Library Systems   Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research.. Libraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the major responsibility for providing public access to the world's literature.. Most universities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized libraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. This use of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally, resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines.. The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this division of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to examine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and the scattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns.. These results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library systems..   Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually estimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data are developed.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its advantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually made relative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines can be defined in comparable terms.. A ""discipline wheel"" is proposed which can serve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines.. This framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and also for measuring the similarity between two disciplines..   One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study of journal productivity is the concept of ""scattering"" of articles or ""title dispersion"".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has resulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various sources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly the Yule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered..   The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, and evaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use in determining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of adding additional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, and building mathematical models of library systems are among some of the applications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivity functions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as a function of the number of subscriptions it receives..   The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to which the above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data was collected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D. dissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Complete records of the university's scientific journal holdings were also obtained.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally satisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientific disciplines is measured as is the similarity between the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is also measured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system's holdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposed and evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions..   This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts as title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity between disciplines, and others.. The quantification of these concepts leads to a basis for the design and evaluation of complete library systems.. ",cisi

This paper describes extensions of this algorithm in the areas of texture simulation and lighting models.  The parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate system which is used as a key for mapping patterns onto the surface. The intensity of the pattern at each picture element is computed as a weighted average of regions of the pattern definition function. The shape and size of this weighting function are chosen using digital signal processing theory. The patch rendering algorithm allows accurate computation of the surface normal to the patch at each picture element, permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections.  The amount of light coming from a given direction is modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture mapping. Several examples of images synthesized using these new techniques are included. ",cacm

5526,"wakes in axial compressors . wakes in axial compressors . the tendency in the past has been to assume that when wakes or non-uniform total head profiles are fed into an axial compressor then substantially constant static pressure prevails at the entry, the variations in total head appearing as variations in velocity . this variation in velocity causes variation in incidence on the early stage blade rows and thus can give rise to excitation of blade vibration . this assumption is implicit, for instance, in references 1 and 2, but we think has been a common assumption by most of the people working in this field .  where the compressor is fed by a duct of substantially parallel walls for a reasonable length ahead, such an assumption appeared justifiable . such a duct when given an air flow test with its outlet discharging, for instance, to atmosphere instead of to the compressor, then the distribution assumed would normally be obtained and in fact many surveys of such ducts have been represented in this fashion . the object of this note is to show that, in fact, this distribution will not normally occur when the compressor is present and we may normally expect much more nearly a constant velocity into the compressor with attendant static pressure distributions to match with the total head variations ahead of the intake, with of course, the attendant curved flow to support the static pressure gradients .

Some factors influencing the cost-effectiveness of retrieval and dissemination systems are identified.. Various aspects of system operation that are susceptible to cost-effectiveness analysis are discussed, including system coverage, indexing policies and procedures, system vocabulary, searching procedures, and mode of interaction between system and user..

3236,"Cost-Effectiveness as a Guide in Developing Indexing Rules   To date, the many decisions among alternatives that are required in the course of developmental efforts to improve indexing have, with few exceptions, been guided primarily by criteria related to effectiveness, as measured by some objective method, or as judged subjectively.. Although effectiveness-type criteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance the state-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriate for operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion that takes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem of operating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexing possible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level of effectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human, machine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type of criterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approach is described and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and of effectiveness were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how to reduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems of defining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discrete steps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans and small-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines..

5532,"an alternative formulation of the problem of flutter in real fluids . an alternative formulation of the problem of flutter in real fluids . it is well known, in steady flow, that the actual lift curve slope is somewhat less than that predicted by inviscid flow theory, even at small angles of attack . as the stall angle is approached, the lift curve slope continually decreases and thus deviates even more from the theoretical value . pinkerton employed the measured circulation to determine the pressure distribution and found that the resulting prediction of the moment is considerably improved over that given by the classical theory . this amounts to replacing the conventional kutta-joukowski condition with the condition that the total lift should agree with the measured value, and this, in turn, completely determines the flow pattern . practically, this is accomplished by giving a fictitious camber to the profile . since potential flow theory is valid outside of the boundary layer, once the boundary-layer thickness is known, the potential flow may be corrected for the displacement thickness and the viscous wake by appropriate source distributions . the boundary layer cannot be evaluated, of course, until the potential flow is known and the circulation is applied . a criterion to determine the circulation, by generalizing the kutta-joukowski condition, was proposed by preston and spence by assuming that the pressure at the trailing edge shall have the same value when determined from the potential-flow values above and below the airfoil . this procedure gives qualitative information concerning viscous effects in steady flow .

The most obvious effect is that increase in productivity due to technology can eliminate jobs. Technology affects the individual worker, in the nature and amount of his work, and in his attitudes toward that work. Technological change affects the occupational structure of the entire labor force. Because of the central importance of these effects, the impact of technology has been the subject of extensive study by economists, sociologists, political scientists, and psychologists.  Even within a single discipline, studies are often contradictory, and conclusions are colored by political overtones.

6122,"2542. symposium on the fine structure and replication of bacteria and their parts. ii. bacterial cytoplasm comparison of the fine structure of the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell with that of the 'cell in general' reveals important differences leading to the conclusion that, in the bacterial cytoplasm, there is little differentiation into separate functional en- tities. there is no nuclear membrane, and fine fibrils appear to extend from the nucleo- plasm into the cytoplasm where they may expand in all directions. the cytoplasm is not necessarily intersected by membranous profiles of special configuration, as is borne out by e. coli b and other gram-negative organisms. when membranous profiles of special configuration are present, as in the gram-positive b. subtilis, these do not appear differentiated into clearly definable endoplasmic reticulum, golgi substance, microbodies, etc., and mitochondria. as for kinetosomes, the presence of centrioles is perhaps not very likely. the experiments in which tellurite is re- duced in the cells suggest that there are structures at the base of the flagella with reductive capacity. however, upon application of the tetranitro-blue tetrazolium technic to b. subtilis, these are not stained. they are presumably identical with basal granules. the membranous structures in b. subtilis are called chondrioids by the author because probably one of their functions is that they are the sites of the respiratory enzyme chain. in the gram-negative p. vulgaris, the probable site of the respiratory chain has a structure very different from that in the bacillus; it is not clear whether membranes are involved in their structure. morphologically, even in b. subtilis chondrioids differ fundamentally from the mitochondria in that they are not built up from composite membranes, they are extensions of the plasma membrane, and they may not be completely closed systems. regarding this last point, it was observed that chondrioids may possibly stand in open connection with the cell's environment, since its lumen is not separated from the cell wall by a plasma membrane. although as yet nothing is known about this, it does not seem to be precluded that these membranous organelles may function also as intracellular transport systems. contrary to porter's ideas about er, the chondrioids are not extensions of a nuclear envelope, but of the plasma membrane. on the other hand, they are in the nuclear area, in direct contact with the nucleoplasm, and therefore, perhaps, they need not carry in their interior some dna, as is now becoming known for ordinary mitochondria. the chromatophore vesicle is of a simple structure and in connection with the plasma membrane. it is covered by a single membrane and thus resembles the granum disc, but it is much smaller. in tissue cells, an im- portant function of the er is the support of protein synthesis by ribosomes bound to their surfaces. evidence is now accumulating that the active complexes for poly- peptide synthesis in bacteria are also membrane-bound and are series of 70s ribo- somes using the same messenger rna molecule. it remains a contradictory situ- ation that the particles obtained here through release of cytoplasm from protoplasts in diluted, rather crude fixing media, and identified as ribosomes, could not be recognized as such in thin sections of the ryter-kellenberger fixed protoplasts. this point is much in need of clarification. but even if the cytoplasm in the thin sections of the protoplasts is in a state of dispersion brought about artificially, it is still apparent from the various micrographs that basically the cytoplasm is a network of presumably linear arrays, with many interconnections due to fibrillar systems. fibrils from the nucleoplasm penetrate deeply into the cytoplasm. the presence of fine fibrils of various thicknesses, electron densities, and orientations makes high-resolution study of the cytoplasmic details an intriguing prospect from which much fundamental information can be gained. the organizational pattern on the ultrastructural level in bacteria reveals fundamental similarities and divergen- cies from that in the 'cell in general'.

2305,"Computers as an Innovation in American Local Governments Computers and electronic data processing are a major technological innovation in the operations of American local government. This paper establishes that there is substantial variation among the larger local governments in the rate at which they adopt computer technology, in the level of financial support they provide for EDP, and in the extensiveness and sophistication of their automated applications. The central question addressed is: What might explain the differences between governments in the extent to which they adopt and use computers? Hypotheses are tested for several streams of explanatory factors, using data from more than 500 city and county governments.  The findings identify certain local government milieus which are particularly conducive to higher levels of computer innovation. Somewhat unexpected findings reveal the significant impact of the distribution of control over EDP decisions and the dominant political values within the government. Other important factors include the measured need for computer applications and the presence of external funding support for computing. Finally, the paper suggests a framework for identifying the key determinants of other technological innovations. ",cacm

Out of their feeling that the Standards for College Libraries and the Standards for Junior College Libraries are inadequate for estimating the size (in volumes) required for minimum adequacy by libraries of institutions of higher education of widely differing characteristics, they developed new formulas for this purpose.. These formulas attempt to identify the principal factors affecting academic needs for books and to ascribe suitable to each factor.. The authors then illustrate the application of the formulas to specific institutions, and conclude that while the results are useful, further research in needed..

The algorithm is an extension of a technique used by Kronecker in a proof that the prime factoring of any polynomial may be found in a finite number of steps. The algorithm consists of factoring single-variable instances of the given polynomial by Kronecker's method and introducing the remaining variables by interpolation. Techniques for implementing the algorithm and several examples are discussed.  The algorithm promises sufficient power to be used efficiently in an online system for symbolic mathematics. ,cacm

6648,"2354. isoantigenic properties of tumors transgressing histocompatibility barriers of the h-2 system sublines capable of transgressing h-2 histocompatibility barriers have been derived from strictly strain-specific tumors by 1) passage through newborn hosts of a foreign genotype; 2) passage through adult h-2 incompatible recipients pretreated with isoantisera directed against the tumor cells. the nonspecific character induced by these procedures was usually expressed in a number of different h-2 incompa- tible recipients. the changes responsible for the conversion to nonspecific growth appeared to proceed in a stepwise fashion. expression of the nonspecific character required exposure to the foreign host environment for more than 30 days. at this stage and during the subsequent 3 transfer generations, reversion to strain-specific growth occurred on back-transfer to the strain of origin; after 4 passages in the foreign hosts the nonspecific character was permanently established, however, and could not be reverted by prolonged passage in the original host genotype. the growth rate of strain-specific tumors and their nonspecific sublines was compared in the strain of origin. no difference was found with one tumor, while the strain- specific line grew better than the nonspecific sublines with another. this difference was detected in the homozygous strain of origin and in different semi-isologous f1 hybrids. all lines grew better in the homozygous strain than in the f1 hybrids, however. a comparison was made between the concentration of h-2 isoantigenic surface determinants in strain-specific tumors and their nonspecific sublines by a quantitative absorption technique in vitro. all nonspecific sublines had a lower concentration of h-2 isoantigens than the strain-specific tumors. this suggests that nonspecific tumors develop as a result of immunoselection of variants resistant to the homograft reaction and are characterized by a lowered concentration of h-2 antigens.

Librarians can only be of limited assistance in helping the naive user formulate an unstructured feeling in his mind into an appropriate search query that maps into the retrieval system.. Consequently, the process of query formulation by the user, interactively with the information available in te system, remains one of the principal problems in information retrieval today..   In an attempt to solve this problem by improving the interface communication between man and the computer, we have pursued the objective of displaying hierarchically structured index trees on a CRT in a decision tree format permitting the user merely to point (with a light pen) at alternatives which seem most appropriate to him.. Using his passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interaction vocabulary by at least an order of magnitude.. Moreover, a hierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may be augmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance to the user.. A hierarchical structure was chosen because it seems to replicate the structure of cognitive thought processes most closely, thus allowing the simplest, most direct transfer of the man's problem into the structure and vocabulary of the system..
